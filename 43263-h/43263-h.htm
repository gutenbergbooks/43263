<h1 title="">THE ARROW OF FIRE</h1>
<h2 id="c1"><br />CHAPTER I
<br />THE SQUAD CALL</h2>
<p>It was midnight. The waters of Lake Michigan
were like glass, smooth glass, miles of
it, blue-black. There was no moon. The stars
burned queer bright holes in the blue-black
glass. The long, low craft that glided through
the water caused scarce a ripple.</p>
<p>At the prow of this Great Lakes&rsquo; freighter
stood Johnny Thompson. He was gazing at
the skyline of his own beloved city. Three
years had passed since last he had caught the
rumble of that great metropolis and had seen
her lights gleaming out into the night. Now he
was gliding slowly, surely forward&mdash;to what?
His city, to be sure. But after that? Mystery?
Romance? Fresh adventure? Who could
say?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">[12]</div>
<p>In his three years of wandering Johnny had
known mystery, romance, and adventure
aplenty. He had glided up dark mangrove-bordered
streams at the heart of tropical
America. He had crept into dungeons in the
haunted castle of Haiti. He had felt the call
of the barren tundras and smoking mountains
of British Columbia and Alaska. He had
faced the savage, hungry wolf pack, and had
matched power and prowess with the Kadiak
bear.</p>
<p>Ah yes, mystery, romance, adventure, had
been his.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">[13]</div>
<p>And yet, as he stood there watching the
skyline of the city he had known so well as a
boy, as her massive buildings bulked larger
and larger before him, as he saw the spire-like
structures that had reared themselves
skyward in his absence, as he thought of the
dark, little known streets, of the hidden cellars,
the underground tunnels, of the wealth, the
misery, the power, the intrigue, the crime of
this, his native city, he could not but feel that
after all he had wandered far in vain, that
even here at his own doorstep was to be found
romance, thrills, adventure such as he had not
known in strange lands. Was he right? Only
time could tell.</p>
<p>So he stood there dreaming until he felt the
boat bump against the massive cement finger
that is the city&rsquo;s Municipal Pier, and knew it
was time to go ashore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;d you come from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A well set up young man, some years his
senior, asked him this question the moment
his feet were on the pier.</p>
<p>He wanted to tell the fellow it was none of
his business. But he had learned caution. He
looked the questioner over from head to toe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some college fellow,&rdquo; was his mental comment
as he took in the other&rsquo;s spick-and-span
appearance. Dressed to the minute, that&rsquo;s
what he was. &ldquo;May be a young reporter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just came down from the North,&rdquo; he said
quietly. &ldquo;Been hunting with bow and arrow.&rdquo;
He whirled his leather cased bow about
as evidence. &ldquo;Caught this boat at Two Harbors.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">[14]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah? Do you always travel that way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Freight? Why, anyway, I&rsquo;ve never waited
for a fancy boat. Take the first one that will
bring me where I want to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bad idea.&rdquo; The stranger&rsquo;s look
changed. &ldquo;Going over town? Bound that
way myself. Mind company?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the same, I wonder who he is and what
business of his it is that I came from somewhere
and am going somewhere else,&rdquo;
Johnny thought, as they passed through a
long, low shed, and turning to the right,
headed down the pier toward the city.</p>
<p>For some time the two walked on in silence.
Johnny was busy studying his rather sudden
friend. His smart black derby, neatly creased
trousers and shining shoes contrasted oddly
with the blue shirt and khaki trousers that
Johnny wore.</p>
<p>But Johnny had formed a habit of looking
through clothes to the man.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">[15]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This chap,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;is no fop.
Hate to meet him when he is full of fight.
Don&rsquo;t get those shoulders, that chest, that
stride drinking pink tea, nor smoking through
his nose. This chap&rsquo;s a man. Hundred per
cent. But why did he pick me up? Try to
find out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Used to live here in this city,&rdquo; he volunteered.
&ldquo;Had a room with another boy in an
old bat roost over beyond the Wells Street
bridge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know the place,&rdquo; the stranger replied.
&ldquo;Gone now. Tore it down. Putting up the
biggest business building in the world there
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are?&rdquo; Johnny was taken aback. This
city of his was too fast for him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure are. Quite a building yours was, too.
Don&rsquo;t matter. Thing&rsquo;s in the way. Down it
comes. That&rsquo;s the city for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again there was a period of silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get a car here.&rdquo; The stranger stopped
beside the curb. &ldquo;One coming now. But
where you going?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">[16]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t thought much about it. Lots of
places in a city. One night, it don&rsquo;t matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on down with me. Like to see that
thing you say is a bow. Can&rsquo;t do much with
it, can you? Come along. Got an extra bunk.
Not much. Good enough for one night,
though. Just down here on Grand. Be there
in ten minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The street car rumbled by. Once more
Johnny marched beside his new-found friend.
And march was exactly the word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walks exactly as if he were going to war,&rdquo;
Johnny told himself. &ldquo;What a queer chap!
Dresses like a college dude. Trains like a
prize-fighter. Walks like a soldier. Worth
knowing, I&rsquo;d say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When, however, they reached a dark opening
between two six story buildings and the
stranger said, &ldquo;This is the place. We go
down. Watch your step. Shaky old stairs,&rdquo;
Johnny experienced something very much
akin to fear.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">[17]</div>
<p>He knew enough about strange cities at
midnight to be on his guard. This part of the
city certainly was not the best. They were
near the city&rsquo;s water front. The river was
two blocks away. Between them and the
water lay endless rows of warehouse slips,
great dilapidated sheds, boats half sunken and
rotting; all this and more.</p>
<p>As he hesitated a truck rumbled down the
deserted street. It turned to the right to enter
a gap of darkness that was a door to the brick
structure nearest at hand.</p>
<p>Cheered by the thought that there was
someone about, he decided to risk it.</p>
<p>Moving cautiously, he followed his companion
down a low flight of stairs, then passed
down an uneven board walk that ran close to
the walls of what appeared to be a dilapidated
one story structure.</p>
<p>Once more a stair confronted them. This
time they mounted upward.</p>
<p>Once at the top the stranger threw open a
door and touched a switch to throw on a flood
of light. Johnny entered. The door was
closed and locked after him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">[18]</div>
<p>The room his eyes took in at a glance was
in strange contrast to its rude exterior. Softly
tinted wall paper, shelves filled with books.
Good pictures, tasty furniture. A man&rsquo;s place;
but neat, with the neatness that comes only at
the touch of a woman&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nice place,&rdquo; said Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like it,&rdquo; the other smiled. &ldquo;Even like
where it is. Know what? This shack is older
than the place where you used to live! Funny,
ain&rsquo;t it? Just a wooden shack. But here she
stands. Life&rsquo;s funny that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny stared at his companion. His words
did not affect him. It was what he did at this
moment that counted most. Having removed
his coat, he unstrapped a belt to lay an automatic
pistol on his dresser. He did all this as
if it were quite the customary thing, part of
his day&rsquo;s business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this,&rdquo; Johnny told himself with an
inaudible gasp, &ldquo;is neither in the movies nor
in the wild and woolly West.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he told himself a moment later,
&ldquo;Whatever&rsquo;s on, I&rsquo;m in for it. I&rsquo;ll not run.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">[19]</div>
<p>Johnny was no weakling, nor was he a
coward. When opportunity permitted he
spent an hour or two each day punching the
bag or swinging the gloves at some real companion.
He was a lightweight boxer of no
mean ability, as you who have read our other
books will know. Just at present he was at
his best. Boxing had been denied him, but
rugged mountain trails, the camp axe, and a
six foot bow had offered opportunities for
training that no indoor sports could match.</p>
<p>Nor was Johnny wholly unarmed. He had
never in his life carried a revolver, yet in the
corner where he had placed it, close at hand,
was such a sturdy yew bow as might have
gladdened the eye of Robin Hood. And beside
it were six ashen arrows with points of
steel keen as a razor blade.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this,&rdquo; he told himself, &ldquo;is Chicago.
My native city. My home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be feeling need of sleep,&rdquo; said his
companion of the hour. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s your bunk.
Turn in when you wish. Don&rsquo;t mind a little
music to lull you to the land of dreams?&rdquo; He
snapped on a radio which stood, until now
quite unnoticed by Johnny, in the corner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">[20]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit. Something soft and low,&rdquo;
Johnny chuckled, &ldquo;like the murmur of a mountain
stream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No chance at this hour. Jazz is all you&rsquo;ll
get.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny disrobed to the tune of &ldquo;Deep
Night&rdquo; which seemed appropriate to the hour.</p>
<p>When he had crept beneath the blankets,
his strange host threw off the house lights,
leaving only one dull golden eye, the radio&rsquo;s
tiny dial lamp, gleaming.</p>
<p>Johnny was truly weary. The day had been
long and full of the inevitable excitement of
arriving. His last impression as his eyes
closed and his senses drifted away was that of
a great golden eye glaring at him from the
dark.</p>
<p>Then, with a suddenness that set his blood
racing, he was sitting up in bed wide-awake.</p>
<p>Loud, jangling, setting his ears roaring, a
gong had sounded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bam! Bam! Bam!&rdquo; It seemed in this
very room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">[21]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;what was that?&rdquo; he stammered as
the sound died away.</p>
<p>As if in answer to his query, a voice came
from the radio:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Squads attention! Squads 21 and 24 go
to Jackson and Ashland at once; a drug store.
Robbers breaking in there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What did it mean? To Johnny the whole
affair was but a confusion of sensations, a
mild affair of the night.</p>
<p>Before his question could be answered the
words came again. &ldquo;Squads 21 and 24 go at
once to Jackson and Ashland; a drug store.
Robbers breaking in there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, in strange incongruity, there came
again the wild, fantastic rhythm of a modern
dance tune.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said the strange host in a quiet tone,
&ldquo;is a squad call. It&rsquo;s a thing the police have
taken up. They hope to check crime that way.
Forty-six squad cars are waiting for the calls.
Two cars are at Jackson and Ashland now.
It&rsquo;s a new stunt.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">[22]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I should say it was,&rdquo; said Johnny as he
began to understand that the sound of the
gong as well as spoken words had come from
the radio. Once more he settled back against
his pillow.</p>
<p>As he lay there now he kept his eyes on
the profile of his host. Dimly lighted as the
room was, Johnny seemed to read on the face
of the man a look of alert expectancy which
had nothing to do with jazz music.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is listening,&rdquo; he told himself. &ldquo;Waiting
for another squad call.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At once questions formed themselves in his
mind. Why did this young man listen so intently?
Where lay his sympathies? With the
police, or with the law breaker? If with the
law breaker, was he interested in some dark
doings of this night? Was he listening for
the call that would tell of the discovery of
his band?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strong body. Clear eyes. Keeps himself
fit. Wonder if law breakers are like that. Be
interesting study. Have to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the midst of his speculations he fell
asleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">[23]</div>
<h2 id="c2"><br />CHAPTER II
<br />A RUNNING BATTLE</h2>
<p>The morning light shone dimly through a
narrow, darkly shadowed window when
Johnny awoke. To the reader it may seem
strange that he had slept so soundly. To the
habitual wanderer a cot, a hammock, or only
a hard floor is made for sleep. The places, a
jungle, an Arctic tundra, a shack in a city&rsquo;s
slums are all the same to him. He sleeps
where he may and leaves trouble to the morrow.
So it was with Johnny.</p>
<p>His first waking thought was of his newfound
friend. As he sat up and stared about
him, he realized that he was alone in the room.
The cot close to his own was mussed up and
empty. His strange friend was gone and his
automatic had passed out with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queer.&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s hand went out for his
trousers and his bill folder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">[24]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All there,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Mighty queer,
I&rsquo;d say. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His reflections were broken off by the
squeak of a door hinge. The outer door had
been opened a crack. It was closed so quickly
that he caught no glimpse of the intruder.</p>
<p>Springing out of bed, he hastily drew on his
clothes, then went to the corner and bathed
hands and face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he breathed, &ldquo;another day. And
once more a city, my native city! My home!
How good it is to live!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He opened the door and stepped outside.
What he saw amazed and puzzled him. The
place in which he had spent the night was a
plain board shack of but one room, built at the
back of a lot. Before it, separated from it
by some ten feet of boardwalk, was a second
low, wood structure. This building was three
times as large as the other, but was, if anything,
in a worse state of repair.</p>
<p>These shacks had evidently been built before
the street was laid, for their eaves were
about on a level with the street walk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">[25]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Queer place to live,&rdquo; he mused as his eyes,
sweeping from left to right, found brick structures
of considerable height on every side.
&ldquo;Queer they&rsquo;d leave such a shack standing.
Stranger still that anyone&rsquo;d care to live here.
Fellow&rsquo;d think&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that instant the back door of the larger
of the two wooden structures opened and a
girl stepped forth.</p>
<p>A girl of sixteen, with well rounded face and
figure, big brown eyes and a disarming smile,
she formed an unforgettable picture, framed
as she was by the gray of decaying wood, the
door frame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello back,&rdquo; said Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You want some coffee? Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Johnny grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But say!&rdquo; he exclaimed as she prepared to
vanish. &ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; He nodded toward
the shack he had just left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drew? Him? He is gone a long time.
Before the sun is up. He is gone. Gone to
work. What kind of work? I don&rsquo;t know.
Fine man, Drew Lane. You know him?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">[26]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny studied the girl as she turned to go
for his coffee. She was dark. Her hair was
black. Her speech was not broken, but her
sentences were short and crisp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Italian. Born in America, perhaps,&rdquo; he
told himself. &ldquo;Wonder why they live here?
No neighbors; no lawn; no garden; no scenery;
no nothing. Only bare walls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She brought him coffee, this girl, and thin
sandwiches spread with odd but delicious preserves.
She set these on a small table in the
room where he had spent the night. He ate
in silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queer old world,&rdquo; he murmured to himself.
&ldquo;Wonder what I should do next.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Opening his bill folder, he counted two hundred
dollars in currency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In Chicago they wear store clothes, I guess
you&rsquo;d call them. Better buy some, I guess.&rdquo;
This to himself. The girl by this time was
gone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">[27]</div>
<p>Leaving his duffel bag and archery equipment
in the corner, he walked out of the place,
boarded a street car and went rattling away
downtown. Twenty minutes later he was engaged
in the dual task of trying on a ready
made suit and convincing the clerk that he had
not always lived in the &ldquo;sticks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two hours later, when he boarded a car
going north, he seemed quite a different person.
Save for the deep tan which life in the
open had bestowed upon him in lavish abundance,
he could scarcely have been told from
any city youth. Such is the transforming
power of clothes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go back to that shack and see if this
fellow, Drew Lane, has come back,&rdquo; he told
himself. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t want to leave without at
least thanking him. Queer sort of chap.
Wonder why he carries a gun? Express messenger
maybe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that he gave himself over to a study of
his fellow passengers. He was standing on
the rear platform. Two of the half dozen men
there attracted his attention. They talked of
cards and gambling. One said he had lost a
&ldquo;leaf&rdquo; last night. What was a &ldquo;leaf?&rdquo; Johnny
couldn&rsquo;t even hazard a guess.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">[28]</div>
<p>The car lurched. Johnny put out a hand to
steady himself. It was his left hand, for he
was decidedly left handed. Strangely enough,
one of the men cast a sharp look at his hand,
then turned to his companion with a knowing
wink. The other replied with a dainty pluck
at his own sleeve, as if to say, &ldquo;See! It&rsquo;s new.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This last action was not lost on Johnny.
They took him for a hick, just because his
clothes were new. He colored behind his ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like to give them a good swift poke,&rdquo; he
thought. Johnny could do it, too, as you probably
know. But Johnny was wise. He knew
how to wait his time. And how very short
the time is on some occasions!</p>
<p>At Grand Avenue he swung about to drop
off the car. Suddenly there was a confused
crowding about him. He felt something hard
strike him in the left thigh. Something
snagged at his pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thieves!&rdquo; he thought. His hand shot down
for his purse. It was gone!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">[29]</div>
<p>&ldquo;So that was it! How dumb I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There they go! I&rsquo;ll get &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He leaped off the car and followed in hot
pursuit.</p>
<p>But what was this? Now there were four.
Two were much younger than the ones he
had seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What of it?&rdquo; He did not slacken his pace.
&ldquo;Get help from somewhere. Can&rsquo;t pick my
pocket in broad daylight,&rdquo; he panted.</p>
<p>Down an alley they raced. The two
younger men had been behind at first. They
were swifter of foot, were catching up with
the two he had seen on the car.</p>
<p>Then of a sudden he caught his breath.</p>
<p>The foremost young man had half turned
his head. In that instant Johnny recognized
his host of the night before, Drew Lane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The dirty dog!&rdquo; he muttered, slowing up.
&ldquo;No wonder he carries a gun! Ho well, let
&rsquo;em have it. You can&rsquo;t get yourself shot to
save a few dollars, especially when you haven&rsquo;t
a chance to win.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">[30]</div>
<p>But what was this? Another wild turn of
events. Having caught up with one of the
men Johnny had seen on the car, Drew Lane
dealt him a blow on the chin that sent him
spinning round and round, and dropped him
with a crash to the ground.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you running about?&rdquo; Drew Lane
fairly shouted. &ldquo;Get yourself killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Leaving him lying there, he went racing on
after the other fugitive.</p>
<p>Still Johnny did not understand what it was
all about. Only one thing was clear. One of
two people had his purse. In that purse was
his remaining one hundred dollars, and some
odd bits of change. There was an even chance
that the man lying on the stones of the alley
pavement was the one. He might at any moment
recover the use of his legs and vanish
with the purse. Johnny needed the money.</p>
<p>Having reasoned this out, he sprinted up to
the spot beside the man and stood there, feet
well placed, hands in position, attentive, expectant.
What he expected came to pass.
Rolling over twice, the man put a trembling
hand to his jaw and stole a furtive glance at
Johnny; then he crept to a position on his
hands and knees closely resembling that of a
racer who prepares for a hundred yard dash.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">[31]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t move, if I were you,&rdquo; said
Johnny, coming a step closer. &ldquo;You are all
out of breath. Besides, you are in no condition
to run. Don&rsquo;t exercise enough, you don&rsquo;t.
Your clothes are all right, quite the thing, I
suppose. But it&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s inside the clothes
that really counts. How&rsquo;d you look stripped?
Huh!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man looked up at Johnny out of the corner
of his eye. He took in the well rounded
shoulders that bulged the lines of his new coat,
noted his hard clenched fist and the clear keen
glint in his eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think you&rsquo;re a smart bunch, don&rsquo;t ya&rsquo;?&rdquo; he
growled. &ldquo;College kids!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not a bunch,&rdquo; said Johnny. &ldquo;And
I&rsquo;m not from college. I&rsquo;m just now from the
sticks. Some day you fellows will learn that
all the boobs don&rsquo;t come from the sticks.
Mostly they don&rsquo;t. They live right here in
the city.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">[32]</div>
<p>&ldquo;As for those other fellows, I don&rsquo;t know
their game. I only know that one of you got
my money, and I want it back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you don&rsquo;t know those other young
fellows?&rdquo; The man&rsquo;s tone sounded his surprise.</p>
<p>Then a light of cunning appeared in his
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All you want is your money? Well, there
it is, kid.&rdquo; He placed Johnny&rsquo;s purse on the
cobblestones, then stole a fugitive glance to
the corner round which the other three had
gone. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got your money back. Sorry
I took it, kid. Just a joke. Joke on a country
kid. Ha! Ha! Guess I can go now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess you can&rsquo;t!&rdquo; said Johnny, paying no
attention to the pocketbook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, I&rsquo;ll tell you!&rdquo; the man exclaimed.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a smart kid. How&rsquo;d a leaf look to
you? Huh? A whole leaf?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A&mdash;a leaf?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. There it is.&rdquo; The man drew a crumpled
bill from his pocket and put it beside
Johnny&rsquo;s purse. It was a hundred dollar bill.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">[33]</div>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s a leaf?&rdquo; Johnny grinned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not much used to city talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave it right here,&rdquo; the man whined.
&ldquo;Now can I go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you can&rsquo;t. Not for ten grand!&rdquo; Johnny
said. &ldquo;And there&rsquo;s some of your crime slang
right back at you. Put up your filthy old leaf.
They grow better ones on cottonwood trees
out in the sticks. Here come the rest of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was true. His host of the night before
was returning down the alley. So, too, was a
slimmer young man with a freckled Irish face.
Between them, looking very much exhausted
and quite disgusted with life, was Johnny&rsquo;s
other street car companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well!&rdquo; said Johnny&rsquo;s host, Drew
Lane, eyeing the purse on the cobblestones.
&ldquo;Exhibit A. Right before my eyes!</p>
<p>&ldquo;That yours?&rdquo; he asked, turning to
Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And these birds took it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure did.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">[34]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What could be sweeter? Luck&rsquo;s with us
this morning, old pard!&rdquo; He patted the
freckled faced Irish youth on the back. &ldquo;Got
a case. All sewed up neat and tight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get up!&rdquo; he ordered. The man on the cobblestones
stood up.</p>
<p>Drew Lane picked up the purse. At the
same time he threw open his coat, revealing a
star. It was the emblem of a city detective.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get it back O.K.,&rdquo; he said to Johnny.
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s ten till you do.&rdquo; He pressed a bank
note into Johnny&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind coming
along, do you? Need you for a witness.
Been looking for these birds for six weeks.
Now we got &rsquo;em; got &rsquo;em dead to rights!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t mind a bit,&rdquo; said Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, you!&rdquo; Drew turned his prisoners
about. &ldquo;March! And make it snappy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Name&rsquo;s Lane,&rdquo; he said to Johnny as they
tramped along side by side, &ldquo;Drew Lane.
Glad I found you. You&rsquo;ve helped us to a
pretty good break. Fellow&rsquo;s record depends
on how many good clean arrests he makes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">[35]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is Tom Howe, my side-kicker.&rdquo; He
grinned as he put his hand on his freckled
companion&rsquo;s shoulder. &ldquo;Detectives mostly
work in pairs. We&rsquo;ve been together a good
long time. Lane and Howe. Lane and HOW!
That&rsquo;s the way they say it.&rdquo; He chuckled.
&ldquo;Pretty good pals, even at that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A police car was called. It arrived. Lane
followed one of the prisoners into a seat.
Howe took the other. Johnny took his place
by the door. They went rattling away toward
the police station.</p>
<p>At the station the prisoners were allowed
to call a lawyer on the phone, then were locked
up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Case&rsquo;ll come up in two or three days,&rdquo; said
Drew Lane. &ldquo;Be in town that long, won&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t thought much about it,&rdquo; said
Johnny. &ldquo;Sort of interested in life, that&rsquo;s all.
Mostly stay around where life&rsquo;s current moves
swiftest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;looks like a good start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No place in the world half as interesting as
this old city,&rdquo; said Drew Lane, gripping
Johnny&rsquo;s hand. &ldquo;Stay with us, and we&rsquo;ll make
you a police captain. Won&rsquo;t we, Howe?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">[36]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And HOW!&rdquo; exclaimed his partner.
&ldquo;Looks like the real thing to me. Bet he could
knock your right ear off with that mit of his
right now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ever box?&rdquo; Drew turned to Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll put on the gloves sometime.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no reason
why you shouldn&rsquo;t shack it with me for a few
days. Why don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; said Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wants to keep track of me,&rdquo; was his mental
comment. &ldquo;Needs me for a witness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See you there at 6:00 P.M. Here&rsquo;s your
purse. We&rsquo;ll need it as evidence later. You
can swear to its contents. Don&rsquo;t let anyone
get it while Howe and I are not around. May
not get it back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right!&rdquo; said Johnny. &ldquo;See you at six.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">[37]</div>
<h2 id="c3"><br />CHAPTER III
<br />TALKING IN THE DARK</h2>
<p>Johnny spent the remainder of the day
sight-seeing. Old friends awaited him,
the Museum, the Art Institute, the State
Street stores. The work along the Outer
Drive amazed and delighted him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great city!&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;Do anything. No
spare land for parks. Make some. Why not?
Goes and gets things, this old city does. No
islands. Dig some from the bottom of the
lake. Great, I&rsquo;d say!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then his brow clouded. He recalled stories
he had heard repeated. Even in the far-away
Canadian woods men had spoken of rampant
crime, gang killings, wholesale gambling and
robbery in his beloved city.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">[38]</div>
<p>But at once his face brightened. &ldquo;A few
hundred fellows like this Drew Lane would
fix that all up. Young, ambitious, fearless college
fellow, I&rsquo;ll bet. Looks like a dude, but
got real stuff in him. Why not a thousand
like him, fresh from college, full of ideals,
ready for fight? Like the men that went to
France. Why not? A thousand strong! The
Legion of Youth. Man! Oh man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, sight-seeing, reminiscing, dreaming, he
wandered through the day to find himself,
toward eventide, wandering back to the low
shack that lay at the foot of many great piles
of brick, and wondered more and more that
such a fellow as Drew Lane should choose so
humble, not to say disreputable appearing,
habitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lot of things go by opposites,&rdquo; he told
himself. &ldquo;Besides, there&rsquo;s that girl. Italian.
But a beauty for all that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was only partly right. The girl had
played a part in it all, but not exactly in the
way he thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just what you been doing with this thing?&rdquo;
Drew asked, taking up Johnny&rsquo;s bow, as he
entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hunting.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">[39]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What did you kill?&rdquo; Drew&rsquo;s brow wrinkled.
&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t kill much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t I though!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny drew forth an arrow and handed it
to him. &ldquo;Exhibit A. I will ask you to examine
the point.&rdquo; Drew felt of the razor-like
edge and whistled.</p>
<p>Taking up a square of pine board, Johnny
set it against the far end of the room. Then,
nocking the arrow, he sent it fleeting. The
arrow struck squarely in the middle, passed
quite through the board and buried itself in
the wainscoting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;ah!&rdquo; said Johnny. &ldquo;&rsquo;Fraid I&rsquo;ve
marred your paint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silent murder!&rdquo; murmured Drew. &ldquo;What
a spiteful little thing of power!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t be bad; not half bad,&rdquo; he mused a
moment later.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bad for what?&rdquo; Johnny asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For an officer. Catch a bunch of yeggs
pulling a job. Pick &rsquo;em off one by one with
that bow, like the Indians used to do wild
turkeys. And gather them up after. Never
know what killed them. I say! We&rsquo;ll have to
add you to our staff!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">[40]</div>
<p>They laughed together, then went out to
the little restaurant around the corner for their
evening meal.</p>
<p>Darkness had fallen when they returned to
the shack, yet Drew Lane did not throw on
the lights at once. Instead, he guided Johnny
to a comfortable chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s just sit and talk,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I like it
best this way, in the dark. You tell me of
the wild woods where the North begins, and
I&rsquo;ll tell you of a city where trouble is always
just around the corner!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me first,&rdquo; said Johnny quickly, &ldquo;how
you came to be at the pier last night and why
you picked me up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing easier,&rdquo; Drew laughed. &ldquo;An officer
of the law is never fully off duty. Tell
you about some of my &lsquo;off duty&rsquo; experiences
some time. You&rsquo;ll be surprised.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">[41]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You see, last night I strolled down to the
pier, just for an airing. Then your ship came
in. Thought I&rsquo;d have a look at anyone who
came off. An extraordinarily large number
of persons enter our country in this way from
Canada and Mexico. Mighty undesirable persons,
many of them. So I was on the lookout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I saw you I guessed you were all
right. But in our business, guesses don&rsquo;t go.
We must have facts. I got them. You were
O.K.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Drew lapsed into silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But that doesn&rsquo;t explain why I am here
now,&rdquo; Johnny suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! That.&rdquo; Drew sat up. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
a natural comradeship between certain people.
If you are one of the parties you know it at
once. I felt sort of related to you. Liked the
way your muscles bulged beneath your
clothes. You had an air of open spaces about
you. I wanted to know you. So here you
are. Regret it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">[42]</div>
<p>So they talked. And as Drew Lane&rsquo;s voice
came to him in a slow and steady murmur
Johnny felt a kindred spirit laying hold of his
very soul. More than once, too, he felt an
all but irresistible impulse to leap to his feet
and dash from the room, for a steady, indistinct
but unmistakable still small voice was
saying to him: &ldquo;This man goes into many
dangers. If you travel with him he will lead
you into great peril. Once you have followed
you cannot turn back. Such is the spirit of
youth, faith, romance, and love for the human
race. Test the steel of your soul well. If you
are in the least afraid it were better that you
turn back now.&rdquo; Johnny listened and humbly
vowed to follow this or any other leader whose
purpose was right and whose heart was true.</p>
<p>An hour passed. At last Drew Lane rose,
stepped across the room and pressed a button
to set a square of light dimly glowing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like a little music?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Johnny did not reply, but waiting, heard as
in a dream the faint, plaintive notes of a violin
creeping into the room.</p>
<p>It rose louder and louder. Then of a sudden,
quite without warning, it was broken in
upon by a terrible, jarring WHONG!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">[43]</div>
<p>Clang! Clang! Clang! sounded a brazen
gong. Then a voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Squads attention! Squads 8 and 11 go to
22nd and Wabash. A man robbed there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The message was repeated. Then again,
quite as if nothing had happened, the violin
resumed its lovely melody.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way it goes at that station,&rdquo;
said Drew. &ldquo;Funny part is that the gong
sings a sweeter song to us than the violin.
It&rsquo;s a great service, son; a great service.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course in time we&rsquo;ll have our own station;
broadcast the calls on a low wave-length.
Only people who get the squad call will be the
boys in the squad cars. Know how it works,
don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Simple enough. Someone reports a robbery,
a burglary or what have you, to the
police by phone. The report is relayed to
headquarters. Headquarters gives it the once
over. Is it important? Out it goes on a private
wire to the radio station. &lsquo;Hold everything!&rsquo;
the radio squad report operator signals
to the other studio people. Then Whang!
Whang! Whang! the report goes out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">[44]</div>
<p>&ldquo;More than forty squads of police, with
loud-speakers in the tops of their cars, are listening,
waiting. Number 9 is called. The
squad car whizzes away. Two minutes later
they are there. Burglars have laid down their
tools to find themselves staring into the muzzle
of an officer&rsquo;s gun. A bank robber has
pulled off a slick daylight affair, only to walk
right into the waiting arms of a detective
squad summoned by the radio. I tell you it&rsquo;s
great.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But after all,&rdquo; his voice dropped, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re
not getting them very fast, not as fast as we
should. It&rsquo;s the professional criminals we
don&rsquo;t get. We&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! There she goes again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more the squad call sounded. This
time it was the robbery of a store by two men
who fled in a green sedan.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">[45]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You might haunt the courts for two weeks
at a time and never see a professional criminal
on trial,&rdquo; Drew went on. &ldquo;And yet
eighty-five per cent of crimes are committed
by professional criminals, men and women
with records, who make a business of crime,
who haven&rsquo;t any other occupation, who don&rsquo;t
want any other, who wouldn&rsquo;t know what
you meant if you asked them to settle down
and live an honest life. In this city one person
out of every three hundred is a professional
criminal. Think of it! Three hundred people
go to work every day, work hard, save their
money, raise their children in a decent manner,
look ahead to old age; and here is one
man who robs them, beats &rsquo;em up, burglarizes
their homes, disgraces their children. And the
irony of it all is, the whole three hundred can&rsquo;t
catch that one man and lock him up. Be funny
if it wasn&rsquo;t so tragic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said Johnny, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s because the
city is so big.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">[46]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well, perhaps.&rdquo; Once more the young officer&rsquo;s
voice dropped. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s discouraging.
And yet it&rsquo;s fascinating, this detective business.
There are boys, lots of them, who think
crime is fascinating. They read those rotten
stories about Jimmy Dale and the rest, and
believe them. I tell you, Johnny!&rdquo; He struck
the table. &ldquo;There never was the least touch
of romance in any crime. It&rsquo;s mean and brutal,
cowardly and small. But hunting down
these human monsters. Ah! There&rsquo;s the
game! You tell of your white bears, your
wolves, your grizzlies. Fascinating, no doubt.
But compared with this, this business of hunting
men, there&rsquo;s nothing to it!&rdquo; He took a
long breath and threw his arms wide.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you,&rdquo; said Johnny with conviction.
&ldquo;I wish I might have a part in it all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. You have made a good start.
You are to be a witness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&mdash;why, that&rsquo;s nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, is it? You wouldn&rsquo;t say so if you
had seen witnesses kidnapped, bribed, beaten,
driven out of town, murdered by the gangs
that all but rule us. A good witness. That&rsquo;s
all we need, many&rsquo;s the time. And lacking
him, the case is lost.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t fail us?&rdquo; he said in a changed
voice.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">[47]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t fail you. When the trial comes
up I&rsquo;ll be there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course.&rdquo; Drew&rsquo;s tone was reassuring,
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to become unduly frightened.
Pickpockets don&rsquo;t band together much.
We seldom have trouble once they are caught.
It&rsquo;s the robbers, the hi-jackers, the bootleggers.
They are the ones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few moments later they turned in for the
night. Johnny, however, did not sleep at
once. He had been interested in all this newfound
friend had told him. He had felt himself
strangely stirred.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If only I could have some real part,&rdquo; he
whispered to himself.</p>
<p>A few moments later he murmured half
aloud, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it! I believe I could do that.
Anyway it&rsquo;s worth the try. Do it first thing in
the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that he fell asleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">[48]</div>
<h2 id="c4"><br />CHAPTER IV
<br />JOHNNY CALLS THE SQUADS</h2>
<p>It was night: ten o&rsquo;clock. Johnny stood
atop a ten story building, looking off and
down. A thousand white lights shone along
an endless way. Like great black bugs with
gleaming eyes, countless cars glided down
that glistening boulevard. To the right, shimmering
waters reflected the thousand lamps.
And at the edge of this water, on a yellow ribbon
of sand, a host of ant-like appearing creatures
sported. These were human beings, men,
women and children, city cave-dwellers out
for a breath of fresh air and a dip in the lake
before retiring for the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How happy they are,&rdquo; he murmured to
himself as their shouts of joy came floating up
to him. &ldquo;And how happy they should be.
The great Creator meant that they should be
happy. And for the most part they have
earned happiness, a brief hour of pure joy after
a day of toil.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">[49]</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;One in three hundred,&rsquo;&rdquo; he recalled
Drew&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;&lsquo;One in three hundred is a
crook.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah well,&rdquo; he sighed, &ldquo;catching the crooks,
and so making those others safer, happier,
freer to enjoy their well earned rewards: that&rsquo;s
our job. And it&rsquo;s a big one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These last were no idle words. Only a day
had passed since his long talk with the young
detective, Drew Lane; yet even in that brief
span of time he had found for himself a part
in the great work, in the task of detecting
crime. A very, very small part it was, but a
real one all the same.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">[50]</div>
<p>He smiled as he thought of it now. In half
an hour he would enter the door at his back,
would pass through a rather large room in
which stood all manner of band and orchestra
instruments, and then would enter a veritable
cubby-hole of a place. In this closet-like room
was a chair, a telephone, a large police gong
set on a steel post, and a microphone. When
these were rightly placed there was room for
Johnny to squeeze himself into the chair, that
was about all. Here, for two hours around
noon, and again two hours at midnight, it was
to be his task to sit waiting for the rattle of the
telephone. Every jangle of that telephone was
to set him into brief but vigorous action. In
a word, he formed the last link between the
unfortunate citizen who was being robbed,
burglarized or attacked, and the police squad
that stood ready to come to his aid.</p>
<p>Johnny had landed this part-time job, which
he felt sure would prove more than interesting,
just as he had secured all else in life, by going
after it. He had spoken to Drew. Drew had
spoken to a police sergeant. The sergeant
had said a word to a captain. The captain,
being just the right person, had spoken to the
manager of the station. And there you are.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And here I am,&rdquo; Johnny said to himself.
&ldquo;And, for the glory of the good old city I have
always loved, I am going to pound that police
gong as no one ever has, and to such good
purpose that someone higher up will say:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">[51]</div>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Good boy! You deserve something bigger
and better.&rsquo;&rdquo; He threw back his head and
laughed. &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; he sighed, &ldquo;maybe they&rsquo;ll
make me an honest-to-goodness detective.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile there was the telephone, the
&ldquo;mike,&rdquo; and the gong. He had taken his
training at noon. Now, from 10:30 P.M. to
12:30 A.M. he was to go it alone.</p>
<p>As he reached the door to his cubby-hole, a
tall, red-headed youth rose and stretched his
cramped legs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quiet night,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;Ought to
have it easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks. Hope so, for the first night at
least.&rdquo; Johnny eased himself into the chair
and the red-headed youth departed.</p>
<p>A quiet night? Well, perhaps. Yet for
Johnny, all unaccustomed as he was to his new
duties, it proved an exciting one.</p>
<p>The very place itself, a great broadcasting
station at night, was filled with interest and
romance.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">[52]</div>
<p>The large studio before him was not in use.
More than a score of instruments, horns, bass
viols, cellos, snare drums, basso drums and
all the rest stood there, casting grotesque
shadows in the half light.</p>
<p>Beyond this, through glass partitions, he
could see a young man. Sitting before an
elaborate array of lights, plugs and switches,
this man put out a hand here, another there,
regulating the controls, directing the current
that carried messages of joy, hope, peace and
good will to the vast invisible audiences out
in the night. He was the station operator.</p>
<p>In the studio beyond, only half visible to
Johnny, the men of a jazz orchestra performed
on saxophones, trap drums and who can say
what other instruments?</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I am now part of it all!&rdquo; Johnny
thought to himself. &ldquo;I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But now came a buzzing sound, a red light
flashed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A call!&rdquo; he exclaimed in an excited whisper.
&ldquo;My first night call.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Placing his finger on a button, he pressed it
twice. This told the operator in the glass cage
to stand by, ready to give him the air.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">[53]</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he spoke into the phone, then
gripped a pencil.</p>
<p>His pencil flashed across the paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got you,&rdquo; he said quietly. &ldquo;Repeat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His eyes followed the lines he had written.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O.K.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now, striking the gong, he spoke into the
microphone: &ldquo;Squads attention!&rdquo; His own
voice sounded strange to him. &ldquo;Squads attention!
Robbers breaking in at 6330 Drexel
Boulevard. Squad 36 assigned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Repeating: &ldquo;Robbers breaking in at 6330
Drexel Boulevard. Squad 36 assigned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more, save for the ticking of his watch
and the faint throb of the jazz orchestra penetrating
the padded walls, his cubby-hole was
silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queer business,&rdquo; he murmured.</p>
<p>He tried to picture what was happening ten
miles away at 6330 Drexel Boulevard. Burglars
had been breaking in. Who had reported
them? He pictured neighbors looking through
a darkened window, seeing the burglars prying
up a window. He saw the neighbors tip-toeing
to a telephone, notifying the police.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">[54]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And then the Chiefs call to me; my call
to the squad. The burglars are inside by now.
And here comes the squad. Clang! Clang!
Clang!</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are not the first arrivals. Nearby
residents have heard the squad call. In dressing
gowns and slippers they have rushed outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the burglars?&rdquo; he mused, settling back
in his chair. &ldquo;Did they get them? Who
knows? If they were professionals, wise to
all the tricks of escape, probably not. If they
were amateurs, first-timers, boys who saw
romance in crime, probably they were caught.
And Drew says one professional is worth ten
first-timers in jail. The first-timer may never
repeat. The professional will never do anything
but repeat. It&rsquo;s his business, his <i>profession</i>.
And what a profession! Bah! I&rsquo;d
rather&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">[55]</div>
<p>Again the buzz; the light. This time it was
a shooting at Halsted and 22nd Streets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drunken brawl.&rdquo; The affair did not interest
him. He put it through with neatness
and dispatch; then he resumed his meditations.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">[56]</div>
<h2 id="c5"><br />CHAPTER V
<br />MYSTERIOUS VIOLENCE</h2>
<p>It was twenty minutes past twelve o&rsquo;clock,
ten minutes before closing time. At this
precise moment a thing happened that was
destined to change Johnny&rsquo;s whole career. It
was to make him a hunter of men.</p>
<p>At this hour the radio studio in an out-of-the-way
corner on the tenth floor of a great
hotel was dimly lighted and spooky. The merry-makers
in the studio beyond had long since
departed. That room was completely dark.
So, too, was the studio nearest Johnny. Even
the dim shadows of musical instruments had
faded into nothing. Two lights burned dimly,
one over Johnny&rsquo;s head, the other directly before
the operator who, half asleep, sat waiting
for the moment when he might cut a distant
ballroom orchestra off the air and follow his
fellow workers home.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">[57]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No more calls tonight,&rdquo; Johnny was thinking
to himself. &ldquo;Quiet night, right enough;
one holdup, two robberies and a shooting. Ho
well, it&rsquo;s been interesting all the same. Fellow
wouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>No, there it was again, one more call. Buzz,
buzz, flash, flash.</p>
<p>He pressed his ear to the head phone, his
lips to the mouthpiece. And then, like lightning
from a clear sky, things began to happen.
He was struck a murderous blow on the head.
He was pitched violently forward. He had a
vague sensation of something resembling a
microphone glancing past him, then crashing
violently against the wall. Other objects appeared
to follow. A sudden shock of sound
burst on his ears, filling the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shot,&rdquo; he thought to himself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m shot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He experienced no pain. For all that, his
mental light blinked out and he knew no more
for some time.</p>
<p>In the meantime the operator in the glass
cage was seeing and hearing such things as he
had never so much as dreamed of.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">[58]</div>
<p>His first intimation that something was
wrong was when Johnny&rsquo;s microphone sent
him a curious sound of warning. This was
caused by someone grasping it in both hands.
Compared to the sound that followed at once,
this was as nothing. Had two freight engines
entered the room from opposite directions and
suddenly crashed they could not have produced
a more deafening hubbub than that
which came from the loud-speaker as the microphone,
hurled by mysterious hands, crashed
against the studio wall.</p>
<p>As the operator&rsquo;s startled senses directed
his attention to Johnny&rsquo;s cubby-hole, and his
eyes took in at a glance the full horror of the
situation, he stood paralyzed with fear.</p>
<p>His chair overturned, Johnny Thompson lay
crumpled on the floor. A shadowy figure
reached up and crushed his light as a child
might a bird&rsquo;s egg. The same figure seized
the police gong and hurled it through a window.
Broken glass flew in every direction.
A telephone followed the gong. Then, as
mysteriously as he had come, the sinister figure
stepped once more into the dark, leaving
wreck, ruin and perhaps death in his wake.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">[59]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; No, not quite. One more act of
violence. Came a flash, a roar, and a bullet
struck with a thud against the padded partition.</p>
<p>The operator promptly dropped flat upon
the floor. Nor did he, being a prudent youth,
rise until heavy feet came stamping up the
stairs and three uniformed policemen, led by
a youth in shirt sleeves, burst into the room.</p>
<p>The young man in shirt sleeves was Drew
Lane.</p>
<p>From the moment Johnny took his first
squad call, Drew had been listening in at his
room. He had come to have a very great interest
in Johnny. &ldquo;Anyone of his courage,
spirit and ambition, coupled with a desire to
be of real service to others, will go far,&rdquo; he had
told himself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just listen in tonight. He
may make a slip or two. If he does I can set
him right.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">[60]</div>
<p>Johnny made no slips. In fact Drew was
obliged to give him credit for a steady hand
and a clear head. Drew had been thinking
of throwing off the radio and turning in, when
the crash of the wrecked microphone reached
him through his loud-speaker in the shack.</p>
<p>With a mind well trained for sudden disaster,
he knew on the instant that something
unusual and terrible was happening in the
studio. What it was he could not guess.</p>
<p>Grasping his automatic, without waiting to
draw on his coat, he had dashed out of the
shack, down one rickety stairway, up another,
and raced. By good chance he had run squarely
into a police squad car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Step on the gas, Mike!&rdquo; he shouted, springing
into the car. &ldquo;East on Grand, then north
on Lake Shore. Something gone wrong at the
broadcasting studio!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The motor purred, the gong sounded as they
were away at sixty miles an hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heard it,&rdquo; Mike shouted above the din.
&ldquo;Guess your young friend dropped his &lsquo;mike&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worse than that,&rdquo; Drew came back. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
heard that happen. This was different.
Worse! Ten times worse!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">[61]</div>
<p>That he was telling the truth you already
know.</p>
<p>And that was how it happened that Drew
and the squad appeared on the scene, exactly
six minutes after the destroyer had completed
his work of demolition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey! What&rsquo;s this? Who&rsquo;s here?&rdquo; bellowed
Mike O&rsquo;Hearne, the head of the squad,
drawing his revolver and leading the way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&mdash;he&rsquo;s gone!&rdquo; The terrified operator
rose shakily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know. Truly I don&rsquo;t. But look!
Look what he&rsquo;s done!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the light switch?&rdquo; Mike advanced
into the studio, tripped over a trap drum,
dropped his gun; then said some words appropriate
to the occasion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here. Just a moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The operator, who was rapidly regaining the
power of his senses, touched a switch and the
room was flooded with light; so, too, was
Johnny&rsquo;s cubby-hole.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">[62]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They&mdash;he shot at me,&rdquo; stammered the
operator, once more thrown into confusion at
sight of Johnny&rsquo;s still form crumpled up beneath
the debris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who shot?&rdquo; demanded Mike.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know much. Looks like they&rsquo;d
done for this boy here. And why, I wonder?
That&rsquo;s always the question. Why? Here,
give us a hand. Let&rsquo;s get him out of here.
Somebody call the house doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Relieved to find there was something definite
he might do, the young operator got the
doctor on the phone at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be up right away,&rdquo; he reported.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hm, let&rsquo;s see.&rdquo; Mike, the experienced
police officer, who had examined a thousand
cases, living and dead, turned Johnny over
carefully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lot of blood,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Hit on the
head. May come round. Doctor can tell.
Bring some water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The operator brought a pitcher of water.
Mike bathed Johnny&rsquo;s forehead, then began
washing away the blood. Johnny had just
begun to stir a bit when the doctor arrived.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">[63]</div>
<p>A full five minutes the doctor remained bent
over the prostrate form.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope he&rsquo;s going to come out of it,&rdquo; Drew
said to a husky, grizzle-haired Irish sergeant
named Herman McCarthey. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a game
kid, and he&rsquo;s got right ideas. He&rsquo;ll go far.
This was his first night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the end of that tense five minutes Johnny
sat up unsteadily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s reviving,&rdquo; said the doctor. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
have some air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Windows were thrown up. Johnny opened
his eyes and looked about him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;where am I?&rdquo; he half whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Right where you were,&rdquo; Drew chuckled.
He was pleased to see the boy coming round
so soon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s eyes held an uncertain
light. Then they cleared. &ldquo;Something hit me.
I&mdash;I went&mdash;went down. The microphone, the
telephone, every&mdash;everything went&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">[64]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; said Herman McCarthey
quietly. &ldquo;Just you take it easy. You&rsquo;ll be fine
and dandy pretty soon. Then we&rsquo;ll take you
home in the car and you can tell us all about
it. He hit you, that&rsquo;s clear. Hit with his gun.
Dent of the hammer&rsquo;s in your scalp. An&rsquo; it&rsquo;s
goin&rsquo; to stay some time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He hit you. We don&rsquo;t know just why. But
we&rsquo;ll find out, won&rsquo;t we, Drew?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know we will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll find the man, won&rsquo;t we, Drew?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We sure will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when we do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when we do!&rdquo; Drew Lane echoed
with appropriate emphasis, and a light grip on
his automatic.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">[65]</div>
<h2 id="c6"><br />CHAPTER VI
<br />WHO? AND WHY?</h2>
<p>Half an hour later Johnny and Drew
were back at the shack. The squad car
with its load of burly policemen was gone.</p>
<p>For a long time nothing was said. Johnny&rsquo;s
head hurt. It also ached in a most extraordinary
manner. He felt sick at the stomach.
Life for him had gone suddenly very strange.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drew,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;that man, whoever
he was, didn&rsquo;t give me a chance, not a
single fighting chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not. They never do, those gangsters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drew,&rdquo; said Johnny, &ldquo;I was hunting in the
Arctic once, stalking a polar bear all alone;
following his track. He turned the tables and
started stalking me. But, Drew, before he
struck at me with that great paw of his, he
hissed like a goose.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">[66]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gave you a warning,&rdquo; Drew said quietly.
&ldquo;Rattlesnake&rsquo;d do that, too; but not a gangster.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny,&rdquo; he said, suddenly wheeling about,
&ldquo;you&rsquo;ve been believing in that old saw, &lsquo;honor
among thieves.&rsquo; Forget it. There isn&rsquo;t any.
Not a bit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve known them to run over a little family
car, smash it in bits with a powerful truck
they were using to carry illicit goods. Did
they stop? Not much. Fired shots in the air,
and left little children to perish in the wreckage.
Honor! Not a bit. I tell you it&rsquo;s war!
Pitiless war waged by monsters. And this
land will not be free until they are all safely
lodged in jail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again for a time there was silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drew,&rdquo; Johnny spoke again, &ldquo;I used to say
that if a man picked my pockets or held me
up and got my money, I&rsquo;d say, &lsquo;You are a
smart guy,&rsquo; and let it go at that, but that if
he hit me on the head I&rsquo;d spend the rest of my
life hunting him. And when I found him I&rsquo;d
kill him. That man hit me, Drew, hit almost
hard enough to kill, and without warning!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">[67]</div>
<p>&ldquo;He did,&rdquo; said Drew, &ldquo;and we are going to
get him, you and I. But after we get him, I
guess we&rsquo;d better let the courts deal with him.
Justice, Johnny, is an arrow, a keen pointed
arrow that goes straight and fair. Sometimes
I think it is an arrow of fire that burns as it
strikes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny thought that a strange expression.
He was to learn more of it as the days passed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First thing we&rsquo;ve got to do to-morrow,&rdquo;
said Drew, &ldquo;is to work out the probabilities?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The probabilities?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. You&rsquo;ve read detective stories?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know how most of &rsquo;em go? A murder.
One of six men may have done the killing.
This one might have, or that one. This one
probably did. And this one, well, you hardly
consider him at all. But in the end, it&rsquo;s always
the one you did not suspect. It&rsquo;s the bunk.
Real life is not like that at all. You have to
figure out what is probably true, and try to
prove that it is true. It usually is.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">[68]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Take this case of yours. You are to be a
kingpin witness in my case against two pickpockets.
Your testimony will convict them.
No doubt about it. Do they belong to a well
organized gang? Did a member of the gang
try to do away with you so you could not testify?
It&rsquo;s been done many times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another possibility. You were about to
put through a squad call. What was that call?
Was it important? Was a big burglary in
progress? Was this man sent up to silence the
radio and prevent the squad call? If that was
the angle, was more than one major crime
committed in that half hour? If so, which one
was connected with the attack upon you?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once again; many a gang&rsquo;s activities have
been interrupted, their purpose thwarted, by
radio squad calls. The leader of one of these
gangs may have decided to take revenge;
hence the raid to-night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">[69]</div>
<p>&ldquo;So you see,&rdquo; he said, rising, &ldquo;there are several
possibilities to work out. The probability
must be reached. Herman McCarthey will
have all the dope in the morning. He will help
us work it out. He is a seasoned trooper and
has a wise old head on his shoulders. Meantime,
you must try to recall every incident connected
with the affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember one thing,&rdquo; said Johnny. &ldquo;It
came to me at this very instant. I didn&rsquo;t see
the man&rsquo;s face, but I saw his hand, a large
dark hand, and it was deeply scarred. It had
a hole in the middle of the palm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; exclaimed Drew. &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t be better.
Take us a long way, that will.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now we must catch three winks. To-morrow
is a big day. To-morrow you are to
be our star witness.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">[70]</div>
<h2 id="c7"><br />CHAPTER VII
<br />IN COURT</h2>
<p>Johnny and Drew were up at eight o&rsquo;clock
next morning. At 8:30 the black-haired,
dark-eyed girl with smiling lips and dimpled
cheeks brought in steaming coffee and some
unusual but delicious pastry.</p>
<p>Drew called her Rosy, and patted her on
the arm. Rosy&rsquo;s dimples deepened.</p>
<p>Who was Rosy? Why did she live in that
other shack among the walls of brick and mortar?
Why did Drew room in this odd place?
Johnny wanted to ask all these questions.
Realizing that their answers did not greatly
concern him, he asked none of them.</p>
<p>At ten o&rsquo;clock he and Drew were seated on
the front bench of the &ldquo;Local 46,&rdquo; the particular
court room in which their pickpocket case
was to be tried.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">[71]</div>
<p>The whole scene was packed with interest
for Johnny. The judge in his box-like coop,
the young prosecutor and the deputies standing
below, the motley throng that filled the
seats at his back, each waiting his turn to appear
as complainant, defendant or witness,
made a picture he would not soon forget.</p>
<p>The judge was a dark-skinned man of foreign
appearance. His hair was long. His eyes
were large, and at times piercing. He sat
slumped down in his chair. When sudden
problems arose, he had a trick of bracing his
hands on the arms of his chair and peering at
a prisoner as a hawk might peer at a squirrel
or a mouse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s Italian,&rdquo; said Drew. &ldquo;Smart man.
Knows his business. Square, too. A good
judge. Lots of fun, too, if he wants to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment two names were called.
Two large men, respectably dressed, walked
up the aisle to take their places at the high,
narrow table just before the judge&rsquo;s stand.
Two officers stepped up beside them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">[72]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Confidence men,&rdquo; whispered Drew. &ldquo;We
all know them. Haven&rsquo;t got a thing on them,
though, I&rsquo;ll bet. Just picked them up on suspicion.
They get thousands every year from
people who are looking for a chance to make
easy money. They&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;See! I told you. The judge is letting them
go. It&rsquo;s not what you know that counts in
court. It&rsquo;s what you can prove.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once more the stage was set. An attractive
young woman, carefully and tastefully
dressed, a young man at her side, a middle-aged
man of stocky build carrying a package,
a young lady of the shop-girl type at his side;
these four stood before the judge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young lady,&rdquo; said the judge, leaning forward
and adjusting his glasses as he spoke to
the well dressed one, &ldquo;you are charged with
the theft of one dress, taken from the store of
Dobbs, Hobson &amp; Dobbs; value $14.00. Guilty,
or not guilty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guilty,&rdquo; the girl murmured with downcast
eyes.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">[73]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is my duty,&rdquo; the judge leaned forward
in his chair, &ldquo;to warn you that if you plead
guilty I may fine you from one dollar to one
hundred dollars, or send you to jail for from
one day to one year. Knowing this, do you
still wish to plead guilty?&rdquo; His tone was impressive.</p>
<p>The girl hesitated. A short, gray-haired
man stepped up and whispered in her ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her lawyer,&rdquo; explained Drew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guilty.&rdquo; The girl nodded her head.</p>
<p>The evidence was presented. Then the husband
of the young lady spoke: &ldquo;If your Honor
please. This is the first time this sort of
thing has happened. I will give my pledge that
it will not happen again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The judge raised himself on his elbows,
stared through his glasses and exclaimed:
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see that it doesn&rsquo;t happen again for sixty
days. The idea! A woman of your intelligence
going into a store and carrying off a dress
that doesn&rsquo;t belong to you and you don&rsquo;t need!
Why did you do it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know, Judge. I&mdash;I just saw it
there. I&mdash;I liked it. So, the first thing I knew
I was taking it away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly. Sixty days! Sit over there.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">[74]</div>
<p>The judge pointed to a row of chairs at the
right of his box; the defendant burst into
tears, dabbled her eyes with an embroidered
handkerchief; her young husband led her to
a seat and, for the time, the affair was ended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The judge will allow her to weep for a couple
of hours,&rdquo; Drew explained in a whisper.
&ldquo;Meantime, his secretary in the back room will
get some people on the wire and look up her
record. If her record is good, he&rsquo;ll set his sentence
aside, put her on a year&rsquo;s probation.
Probably never hear from her again. She&rsquo;s
had about enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why do they do it?&rdquo; he exclaimed in
a whisper. &ldquo;If you were a young woman would
you go through all this and carry the memory
of the humiliation and disgrace through a long
life for a fourteen dollar dress? You would
not; nor for forty dresses!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they do it, over and over and over.
Hats, belts, coats, dresses, artificial flowers.
What don&rsquo;t they steal? And they come to
court, sometimes three or four a day, to stand
before the judge and weep. You&rsquo;d think they&rsquo;d
learn, that everyone in the world would learn
after awhile, everyone, except the professional
shoplifter. But they don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">[75]</div>
<p>And now a score of young black men stood
before the bench. They were accused of gambling
with dice. The dice, a hook for raking
them in, and a few coins were offered in evidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was running this game?&rdquo; the judge
thundered at them. Nobody knew; not even
the arresting officer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said the judge, &ldquo;you all working?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ya-as, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Got good jobs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ya-as, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Louder.&rdquo; The judge cupped a hand to his
ear. &ldquo;You all got real good jobs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ya-as, SIR!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, you can go, but we have a police
benefit fund here. If you&rsquo;ve all got real
good jobs you might contribute a dollar each
to that fund.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The black men went into a huddle. They
produced the required sum and marched out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">[76]</div>
<p>&ldquo;One of the judge&rsquo;s little jokes,&rdquo; Drew
smiled. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how he could live through
all this low down squalor day after day if it
wasn&rsquo;t for his jokes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to tell you, Johnny, I wish I could
tell every boy in the land a thousand times,
crime is not attractive! It is mean and low
down, sordid and dirty. That&rsquo;s the best you
can make out of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One more case,&rdquo; he whispered as he rose,
&ldquo;then comes ours. You wait here. I&rsquo;ll go get
the men.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">[77]</div>
<h2 id="c8"><br />CHAPTER VIII
<br />PRISONERS AT THE BAR</h2>
<p>Johnny will never know what that next
brief trial was about. It had struck him
all of a sudden that he was to play a part in
the trial that was to follow. This thought set
his blood racing. He was glad not to be the
defendant. But as a witness his responsibility
was great. For the first time in his life he was
to utter words that would without doubt send
a fellow human being to jail. The thought
was not pleasing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet it&rsquo;s my plain duty,&rdquo; he told himself.
He found much consolation in that.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">[78]</div>
<p>A fresh turn of his mind for the moment
crowded out all other thought. Who had beaten
him up the night before? Was it some
pal of these pickpockets? Would he be able
to tell from the expressions on their faces
when they saw him? His head was heavily
bandaged. &ldquo;They could not help but notice
that. Perhaps they believe that their confederate
made a thorough job of it,&rdquo; he told himself.
&ldquo;They may not expect to see me here at
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! Now&rsquo;s the time!&rdquo; he whispered to
himself. His name was being called. So, too,
were the names of the two pickpockets and
Drew Lane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here they come.&rdquo; He caught his breath
and half rose from his chair. As he did so,
one of the two prisoners coming down the
aisle caught sight of him. It was the larger
of the pickpockets. For ten seconds he stood
there motionless, one foot poised in midair.
Then his face spread in a broad grin, and he
marched on up to the bar.</p>
<p>That grin puzzled the boy. &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t grin
if he hadn&rsquo;t expected to see me,&rdquo; he reasoned.
&ldquo;But why the grin at all?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">[79]</div>
<p>There was no further time for such thoughts.
He was at the bar, between a police officer and
a pickpocket. His right hand was in the air.
He was being sworn to &ldquo;tell the truth, the
whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so
help me, God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It struck him all of a sudden that some witnesses
these days truly needed Divine help if
they told the whole truth. He felt his bandaged
head, and resolved to honor his oath,
come what might; not only now, but always.</p>
<p>The judge went through with the usual formalities.
The prisoners were charged with
the theft of a purse. Guilty, or not guilty? A
hook-nosed lawyer had advised a plea of
guilty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you wish to be tried by this court?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, your Honor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prisoners were warned of the possible
outcome. Did they still wish to plead guilty?
They did.</p>
<p>The trial began. Johnny was asked to tell
his story. This he did in a straightforward
manner, in spite of numerous interruptions
from the lawyer for the defence. He neglected
no detail of the little drama that was played
by Drew and Howe, two pickpockets and himself
on that fateful June day.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">[80]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Is that true?&rdquo; The judge leaned forward
to glower at the older of the two prisoners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, your Honor. But, your Honor, it&rsquo;s
the police. They&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a moment,&rdquo; the judge cut him short.
&ldquo;I asked you a question. You say this young
man has told the truth? Very well.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now you tell us what you know.&rdquo; He nodded
to Drew Lane.</p>
<p>Drew said that he and his fellow detective,
Howe, had been riding that car line for three
days, because there had been several losses by
surface line riders along that line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we saw these two birds,&rdquo; he went
on, &ldquo;we knew we had our men. We&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You knew them?&rdquo; the judge interrupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s our business to know them. We know
more than three hundred pickpockets by
sight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re too darn smart!&rdquo; snarled the slighter
of the two prisoners.</p>
<p>The bailiff rapped for order.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have these men a record?&rdquo; the judge
asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">[81]</div>
<p>Drew Lane passed up two sheets of paper.</p>
<p>The judge studied these with a gathering
scowl. Then his face lighted as he looked at
Drew Lane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bad ones. That right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Drew nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on. Tell us what happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We saw them take this boy&rsquo;s pocketbook.
They saw us and made a break for it. We
nabbed them. That&rsquo;s all. What this boy told
you is true, as far as we saw it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be,&rdquo; agreed the judge. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t
even deny it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you got to say?&rdquo; He turned
a poker face toward the prisoners.</p>
<p>The larger one answered, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the police,
Judge, and the detectives. I was goin&rsquo; to tell
you, Judge. They won&rsquo;t leave us alone. We
been out of the jug six months. Been goin&rsquo;
straight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call picking pockets going straight?&rdquo; the
judge flashed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We wouldn&rsquo;t have done it, Judge, only
them college boy detectives made us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">[82]</div>
<p>He glared at Drew Lane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Honor,&rdquo; a flicker of a smile hovered
about Drew Lane&rsquo;s mouth, &ldquo;I object to being
called a college kid. I&rsquo;ve been out of college
four years, and been in the service all that
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; the judge leaned forward
and pretended to whisper, &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t object
at all if I were you. It&rsquo;s your greatest
asset. They don&rsquo;t know you&rsquo;re a detective,
these fellows, and when they do they don&rsquo;t
take you seriously. That right?&rdquo; He winked
at the older pickpocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was it, Judge. You see, Judge,&rdquo; the
man went on, encouraged by the judge&rsquo;s disarming
smile, &ldquo;I knew this boy was a detective.
I&mdash;I&rsquo;d see him before, and I says to Jimmy,
me pal here, I says, just whispers, y&rsquo; understand,
&lsquo;Jimmy,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;it would be great
sport to grab that country boy&rsquo;s wad right before
this college boy detective&rsquo;s eyes.&rsquo; We done
it for sport, Judge, honest we did.&rdquo; The prisoner
essayed a laugh, which turned out number
one common, and scarcely that.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">[83]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said the judge, leaning back in his
chair and appearing to think deeply. &ldquo;You
stole a hundred dollars from an innocent boy
as a joke on a boy detective? You were getting
off the car, weren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, your Honor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the boy was getting off to go another
way. How did you expect to get his money
back to him? How did you mean to explain
his loss to him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Honor, we&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah no! You didn&rsquo;t do it as a joke!&rdquo; The
judge leaned far forward. There was a glint
of fire in his eye. The smile had faded from
his face as a field of sunshine is blotted out by
dark October clouds. &ldquo;You meant to steal that
boy&rsquo;s pocketbook. These records show that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It didn&rsquo;t matter to you that this boy might
be left penniless in a strange city. If it had
been a poor shop-girl with two weeks&rsquo; pay in
her purse, the price of a well earned week&rsquo;s
vacation, you&rsquo;d have done it too. It wouldn&rsquo;t
have meant anything to you if it had been a
scrub-woman. If the money had been earned
by eight hours of scrubbing six days a week,
you&rsquo;d have taken it just the same.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">[84]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to go straight. You want
to be pickpockets. That&rsquo;s the only occupation
you have. It&rsquo;s the only one you&rsquo;ll ever have,
except when you&rsquo;re in jail. And that&rsquo;s where
you&rsquo;ll be for some time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six months. Take them away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The deputies led the prisoners down the
aisle. Johnny followed Drew out into the
bright sunshine of a beautiful June morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s the way they do it?&rdquo; Johnny said
breathlessly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the way they do it sometimes,&rdquo; replied
Drew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he went on to explain, &ldquo;you are
a transient witness. You are here now. But
if we needed you to appear before a jury as a
witness in this case four months from now,
would you be in Chicago?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Four months is a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">[85]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Sure it is. Ordinarily those fellows would
have gone before a grand jury and been held
over to the higher courts. They&rsquo;d been tried
by a jury and got three or four years; that is,
if you were present. But the judge, knowing
you were likely to leave the city, made the best
of things and tried them for larceny. He gave
them all he could, under the circumstances.
They are out of the way for a while at least.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s that!&rdquo; Drew said a moment
later. &ldquo;Thanks a heap. You made our case for
us. You helped us; now it&rsquo;s up to us to help
you find the fellow who battered up your head.
Herman McCarthey is in the station now.
Let&rsquo;s go back and see what he&rsquo;s uncovered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Retracing their steps, they walked once
more into the lobby of the police station and
waited for an up-bound elevator.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">[86]</div>
<h2 id="c9"><br />CHAPTER IX
<br />CLUES</h2>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s queer the way the thing works out.&rdquo;
Sergeant McCarthey looked the two
boys squarely in the eyes when Drew Lane
asked him how he had progressed with the
radio station case.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Johnny was sizing up the sergeant.
Nothing very wonderful to look at, this
Sergeant McCarthey. Average size he was,
with a face like a hawk. His nose was too long.
It was curved like a beak. Shining out from
behind it were two small black eyes. His head
was, for the most part, bald, and he was but
forty-five.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reminds me of a bald eagle,&rdquo; Johnny told
himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">[87]</div>
<p>To complete the picture Johnny discovered
an ugly scar running down the sergeant&rsquo;s
jaw and around his neck. The sergeant had
got that scar during his first year of service.
A holdup man, caught in the act, had pretended
to surrender. He had given up his gun, but
seeing an opening, had stabbed McCarthey,
half behind his back. From that time on McCarthey
began earning the name of the hardest
man on the force. Certainly he made them
&ldquo;stick &rsquo;em up, and keep &rsquo;em up.&rdquo; For all that,
there were those who knew that the sergeant
had a very human side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you think, Drew?&rdquo; he shot at the
young detective. &ldquo;Do you think those pickpockets
had their gang walk in on this boy and
beat him up?&rdquo; He was speaking of Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell the truth, I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Drew Lane.
&ldquo;First place they laughed when they saw him.
If&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t tell as much about a crook&rsquo;s laugh
as you can a bullfrog&rsquo;s croak,&rdquo; McCarthey
broke in. &ldquo;Not as much. When a frog croaks
he&rsquo;s saying he&rsquo;s happy. A crook&rsquo;s liable to
laugh when he gets ten years.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">[88]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not just that,&rdquo; said Drew. &ldquo;You know
yourself that pickpockets are sneaks; coyotes,
not wolves. They may be well organized in
some cities. They&rsquo;re not in this one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; said McCarthey, shuffling
a sheaf of papers on the desk. &ldquo;That possibility
is about all there is to that clue. But we&rsquo;ll
keep the sheets; you never can tell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I work it out this way.&rdquo; He spread five
sheets of paper on the desk. &ldquo;See! This one
is for your pickpocket friends who are naturally
afraid of Johnny as a star witness against
them. We&rsquo;ll put it over here.&rdquo; He laid it
aside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what about the squad call that was
going through when the raid on the radio station
was made?&rdquo; Drew broke in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming to that. That&rsquo;s the queer part,&rdquo;
the sergeant went on. &ldquo;You see I have four
sheets left. That means four possibilities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since you insist, we&rsquo;ll take the call that was
going through when the station was raided.
You&rsquo;ll be surprised. That squad call was a notice
that someone was breaking in over on
Lake Shore Drive. Swell apartment. People
all gone. When the radio failed to give the
alarm, a squad was sent out from the local
police station, and the burglars were caught.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">[89]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Johnny leaned forward expectantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I thought,&rdquo; grumbled the sergeant.
&ldquo;But they turned out to be two kids,
one about twenty, the other younger. Dressed
like college kids, they were, in yellow slickers
decorated with hearts and kewpies; you know
the sort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But let me tell you one thing. You may lay
a bet those boys never saw the inside of any
college. I&rsquo;ve been watching. We don&rsquo;t get
many real college boys. When they&rsquo;re smart
enough and good enough workers to get up
to college, they&rsquo;re too smart to think they can
beat the game by turning crooks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where did the boys come from?&rdquo; Johnny
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what they didn&rsquo;t tell,&rdquo; said McCarthey.
&ldquo;If we knew, it might throw some light
on the subject. But you can see how likely it
is that a bunch of kids are going to figure out
that they&rsquo;ll get caught burglarizing an empty
flat unless they send someone to beat up a
radio announcer or two. And besides, if they
did, who would they get to go for &rsquo;em? Too
dangerous. Lot worse than burglarizing.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">[90]</div>
<p>&ldquo;So that,&rdquo; he threw the second sheet aside,
&ldquo;looks like a doubtful chance. But we&rsquo;ll keep
&rsquo;em all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another queer thing.&rdquo; He turned to the
third sheet. &ldquo;Not many cases go out over the
air. We can handle &rsquo;em other ways. Three an
hour is a good many. But in that fifteen minutes
when the radio station was dead, smashed
to bits, there were three squad calls that did
not go out, and two were mighty important.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know that long row of warehouses
just back of your shack, Drew?&rdquo; He turned
to Drew Lane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some cracksmen burst the safe in the third
one from the water, ten minutes after the radio
station was smashed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That looks like a hot scent,&rdquo; said Drew,
starting forward to bend over McCarthey&rsquo;s
sheet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">[91]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Rather blind one, at that,&rdquo; said the sergeant.
&ldquo;No one saw them. A straggler heard
the blast and turned in the alarm. Squad
came. Safe was looted. Birds flown. Might
have gone a dozen ways, rowboat, on foot, in
a car. Gone, that&rsquo;s all. Got something over a
thousand dollars. Left nothing, not even a
fingerprint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad,&rdquo; sighed Drew. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d say that
was the likely case. Going to blow up a safe.
Mighty few cases these days. Since the radio
gave us a lift, electric drills are cheap. Radio&rsquo;s
too quick for them. Whang! goes the blast;
r-ring-ring! the telephone; gong-gong! the radio;
and the police squad is on the way; all
too soon for the safe-cracker.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Easy enough to see why they&rsquo;d send an accomplice
over to break up the radio!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, well!&rdquo; McCarthey&rsquo;s narrow eyes contracted.
&ldquo;Give us time. Not so many of &rsquo;em
escape us.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">[92]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The other case that came off in that fateful
quarter of an hour was a theatre holdup on
State Street, just over the river; one of those
quiet little affairs. Two men say, &lsquo;Stick &rsquo;em
up! Give us the swag. Don&rsquo;t yell! Don&rsquo;t move
for a full minute, or you&rsquo;ll be dead!&rsquo; A car.
Quick getaway. And there you are!</p>
<p>&ldquo;No clue. Nothing to go by. One of those
things that are mighty hard to trace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you don&rsquo;t think they could have had
a friend&mdash;&rdquo; began Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who made you a call? Not likely,&rdquo; McCarthey
laughed. &ldquo;Little those birds fear the
radio. They&rsquo;re too quick. No radio will ever
stop &rsquo;em. They&rsquo;re like the army transports
during the war that were too fast for the submarines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This last sheet,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I have saved
for gentlemen who, on other occasions, have
had their gentle business of robbing, burglarizing,
bombing, safe-blowing and the like interfered
with. From time to time I will enter
the names here of those who show undue resentment
to the radio activities of the police.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that, boys,&rdquo; he concluded, once more
shuffling his sheaf of papers, &ldquo;appears to bring
the case to date. These are the facts. Draw
your own conclusions.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">[93]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Conclusions!&rdquo; Johnny said as he left the office.
&ldquo;I only conclude that I was slugged; that
my telephone was smashed; and that my head
still is very sore.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give him time,&rdquo; said Drew. &ldquo;He seldom
fails. In the meantime, we must do our bit.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">[94]</div>
<h2 id="c10"><br />CHAPTER X
<br />A ROYAL FEAST</h2>
<p>That evening at nine o&rsquo;clock Johnny was
given a delightful surprise. At the same
time some of the questions that had been revolving
about in his mind like six squirrels in
one cage were solved.</p>
<p>He had returned to the shack at six. Weary
from his exciting day, he had stretched himself
out on his cot and had at once fallen
asleep.</p>
<p>Awakened by someone entering the room,
and startled by the darkness that had settled
upon the place since he fell asleep, he was
about to cry out in alarm when the place was
flooded with light and he found Drew Lane
smiling down upon him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have a good rest?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine. And you? What luck this afternoon?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">[95]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No luck at all. But that&rsquo;s what one must
expect. You can&rsquo;t get &rsquo;em every day. If you
did you&rsquo;d soon be out of a job. All the crooks
would be behind the bars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that I&rsquo;d care,&rdquo; he hastened to add.
&ldquo;There are a lot of occupations more congenial.
If I didn&rsquo;t have a conscience that keeps
me hunting men, I&rsquo;d take up commercial aviation.
There&rsquo;s a job for you! I can fly. Have
a hundred and ten hours to my credit, and never
a crack-up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think they&rsquo;ll ever use airplanes in hunting
criminals?&rdquo; asked Johnny, sitting up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might. Couldn&rsquo;t do much right in the city.
But if a gang was supposed to be leaving
town; if the car they used was well marked,
you could do a lot with a plane; soar about,
watching a hundred roads at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had anything to eat?&rdquo; Drew asked, as
Johnny rose and busied himself with his toilet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not since noon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My treat to-night. And you&rsquo;ll like it. Mrs.
Ramacciotti has some ravioli a la Tuscany
on the stove.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">[96]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see. Just get on your collar and tie.
We&rsquo;ll want plenty of time for a feast before
you go back there to get beaten up again.
Or are you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Think I&rsquo;d stay away?&rdquo; Johnny gave him
a look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I didn&rsquo;t. But if I were you I&rsquo;d sit with
my back to the wall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do more than that. Take &lsquo;Silent Murder,&rsquo;
as you call him, along.&rdquo; He nodded toward
the bow that stood in the corner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too slow. Better get a gun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Slow! Sometime I&rsquo;ll show you. That
studio is all of twenty-five feet long. Door&rsquo;s
at one end. My cubby-hole&rsquo;s at the other.
Let anyone try getting to me after this!&rdquo; He
picked up an arrow and felt its razor-like point.
&ldquo;Silent murder,&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;About right, I
guess.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">[97]</div>
<p>To Johnny&rsquo;s surprise he found that the feast
Drew had alluded to was just ten steps from
their own door. Down one low flight of stairs,
up another, and there they were in the shack
that stood before their own and fronted the
street.</p>
<p>A large, dark-skinned woman of middle age
greeted them with a smile that was genuine,
and a handshake that was &ldquo;all there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Mrs. Ramacciotti,&rdquo; said Drew.
&ldquo;Without her and Rosy this city would be a
dreary place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosy stood by the table dimpling and smiling
her thanks.</p>
<p>Johnny had seen Rosy before. Now, however,
she was dressed for the occasion, and
one good look at her made him think of cool
meadows, shady orchards, blushing russet apples,
and all the rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t blame Drew,&rdquo; he told himself.</p>
<p>They were invited to take seats before a
small square table covered with a cloth of
snowy linen. At once a steaming platter was
set before them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s on the platter?&rdquo; Johnny asked
himself. &ldquo;Dumplings in meat gravy?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">[98]</div>
<p>It was far more than that. The finest of
chicken meat, run through a grinder, some
fine chopped veal; carrots cut fine, and who
knows what else of viands and seasoning had
been mixed together and used as the filling
for small, turnover pies. These had been
boiled for half an hour in salt water. After
that they were smothered in rich gravy. A
layer of meat pies, then one of gravy, then
pies again until they stood a foot high on the
platter.</p>
<p>But then, who can describe ravioli a la Tuscany?
It is the proudest dish of Italians, and
they are an exceedingly proud people.</p>
<p>For a full half hour the time was spent between
small talk, and much eating.</p>
<p>As Johnny pushed back his chair with a
sigh of regret, Mrs. Ramacciotti put her hand
to her hair, and said in a sympathetic tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your head. What could have happened to
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you heard?&rdquo; exclaimed Drew.
&ldquo;Some gangster beat him up last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the miserable ones!&rdquo; Madame spread
her hands in horror. &ldquo;But why? He is only
a boy.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">[99]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you,&rdquo; said Drew. He proceeded to
tell of Johnny&rsquo;s unusual adventures.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the only thing we know,&rdquo; supplemented
Johnny at the end, &ldquo;is that the man has a
hole in his hand. I saw that. I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But what was this? Rosy had uttered a low
scream, then had dropped into a chair. Her
face had gone white.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now! Now!&rdquo; her mother said, placing a
protecting hand across her shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; the Italian mother&rsquo;s face took on
added character as she spoke in a low, clear,
steady tone, &ldquo;her papa was shot by a man.
He wanted papa&rsquo;s money. He would give. But
he not always understand. He move his hand
to pocket. Always he did so when he was
nervous. This man shoot him&mdash;dead! Rosy,
she see this man. See hole in the hand. Same
man? What you think? Mebby so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny and Drew stared at one another.</p>
<p>Johnny was thinking, &ldquo;So the man who beat
me up was a murderer!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never told me this before,&rdquo; said Drew,
speaking to Mrs. Ramacciotti.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">[100]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No. I did not know you then. You did
not work on the case. The man, he was never
found.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Drew as his lips drew together
in a tight line, &ldquo;now we know, and we have a
double reason for getting the man with a hole
in his hand. And we will get him. Never
fear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This unfortunate interruption of their party
ended in a prolonged silence. In the end the
two boys expressed sincere thanks for the
splendid feast and begged to be excused.</p>
<p>Rosy, with an effort, summoned one of her
sweetest smiles of farewell. As she stood there
framed in the door, a brave little orphan of
gangland&rsquo;s making, Johnny could not help
feeling that their common tragic interest in
finding the man with a hole in his hand was
destined to bring them very close together in
the days that were to come. Nor was he far
wrong.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">[101]</div>
<h2 id="c11"><br />CHAPTER XI
<br />SWORN TO STAND BY</h2>
<p>Johnny&rsquo;s return to the radio studio that
night caused quite a sensation. He arrived
somewhat ahead of time. The girl who
presided over the switchboard, one floor lower
than the studio proper, was still at her post.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gee!&rdquo; She stared at him, wide-eyed. &ldquo;They
nearly killed you, didn&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tried it, I guess,&rdquo; Johnny admitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And still you came back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lightning never strikes twice in the same
place,&rdquo; Johnny laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does. I&rsquo;ve seen it. Very same tree. Going
to strike twice here, too. Something tells
me that. You&rsquo;ll see. They&rsquo;ll bomb this place.
When those Sicilians start a thing they never
quit &rsquo;til they get what they want. That&rsquo;s what
my dad says. And he knows. I&rsquo;m quitting;
to-morrow night&rsquo;s my last. Dad says, &lsquo;Let the
police do their own work.&rsquo; And that&rsquo;s what I
say, too.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">[102]</div>
<p>&ldquo;If the officers of the law were not backed
up by the honest people of a great city like
this,&rdquo; Johnny replied thoughtfully, &ldquo;nobody&rsquo;s
life would be safe for a moment. In such times
as these every man must do his duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for me, sonny, not for me! I know
where there&rsquo;s a safe place to work, and me
for it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny climbed the stairs with heavy steps,
only to learn that his operator of the night
before had also quit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quit us cold,&rdquo; was the way Bill Heyworth,
the sturdy night manager and chief announcer,
put it. Bill was thirty, or past. He was a broad
shouldered Scotchman with a stubborn jaw.
&ldquo;Said he didn&rsquo;t want to be shot at. Well,&rdquo;
he philosophized, &ldquo;guess nobody does. But
somebody has to carry on here. This thing is
not going to stop because the gangs want it
stopped. In time, of course, the city will have
a station of its own. That will let us out.
But until then the squad calls will go through
if we have to call upon the State Militia to
protect us. This city, officer and civilian, has
set itself for a cleaning up. And a cleaning it
shall be!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">[103]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he asked, as Johnny drew
forth his six foot yew bow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A plaything, you might say,&rdquo; Johnny
smiled. &ldquo;Then again you might say it has its
practical side. I&rsquo;ll demonstrate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Picking up a bundle of magazines, he set
them on end atop a table against the wall. The
outermost magazine had an oval in the center
of its cover-jacket the size of a silver dollar.</p>
<p>Johnny drew back to the end of the room,
then nocked an arrow and drove it through
the very center of that spot.</p>
<p>Bill Heyworth whistled. He whistled again
when Johnny showed him that four of the
thick magazines had been pierced by the arrow&rsquo;s
steel point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Johnny, laughing low, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t expect ever to use it here. But I&rsquo;ll feel
safer if you allow me to turn that chair about
so I&rsquo;ll be facing the entrance to this studio and
have this &lsquo;Silent Murder,&rsquo; as Drew Lane calls
it, close at hand. Do I have your permission?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">[104]</div>
<p>&ldquo;With all my heart, son. With all my heart.
And you&rsquo;ll stick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Till they drag me out by the feet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two of us!&rdquo; The Scotchman put out a
hand. Johnny gripped it tight, then went to
his post.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>The days that followed were quiet ones for
Johnny. There needs must be many quiet days
in every life. These days, calm as a May morning,
placid as a mill pond, give us strength and
fortitude for those stormy periods that from
time to time break upon us.</p>
<p>But these were not uninteresting days. Far
from it. Hours spent in a fresh environment,
among new and interesting people, are seldom
dull.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">[105]</div>
<p>There are few more interesting places than
the studio of a great radio station. Besides
the never ending stream of famous ones, great
authors, moving-picture actors, statesmen,
musicians of high rank, opera singers, and
many more, there are the regulars, those who
come night after night with their carefully prepared
programs planned to entertain and
amuse a tired world.</p>
<p>That he might cultivate the society of those
more skilled, more famous than he, Johnny
arrived night after night an hour or two ahead
of his schedule.</p>
<p>He came, in time, to think of himself as
one of them. And he gloried in this rich
environment.</p>
<p>Bill Heyworth, the night manager, was himself
worthy of long study. A doughty Scotchman,
sturdy as an oak, dependable as an observatory
clock, brave as any who ever wore
kilts, a three year veteran of the great World
War; yet withal, bubbling over with good humor,
he was a fit pattern for any boy.</p>
<p>Quite different, yet not less interesting, were
the comedy pair, one very slim, one stout, who
came in every evening at ten o&rsquo;clock to put
on the adventures of a German street band.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">[106]</div>
<p>Not all the skilled musicians were transients.
The Anthony Trio, piano, violin and cello,
might have graced the program on many a
notable occasion, yet here they were, night
after night, sending out over the ether their
skillful renditions of the best that other times
have produced in the realm of music.</p>
<p>Dorothy Anthony, the violinist, a short, vivacious
girl with a well rounded figure and
dancing blue eyes, seemed no older than Johnny
himself. Many a talk, gay and serious,
they had, for Dorothy took her outdoor adventures
at second hand. She listened and exclaimed
over Johnny&rsquo;s experiences in strange
lands, and insisted more than once upon his
demonstrating his skill by shooting at the
magazines with his bow and arrow.</p>
<p>As for his bow, it stood so long in the corner
that it seemed certain that it would dry
out and become too brittle for real service in
emergency.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">[107]</div>
<p>Though Johnny enjoyed the company of
the great and the near-great, he found most
satisfaction in his association with a certain
humble individual who occupied a small space
before the switchboard at the foot of the stairs.
And that person was none other than Rosy
Ramacciotti. Since Johnny had been told that
Rosy was in need of work, he had hastened to
secure this position for her.</p>
<p>He had thought at first, because of her father&rsquo;s
most unhappy death, she, too, might be
afraid. When he suggested this to her he was
astonished by the snapping of her black eyes
as she exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me afraid? No! I am Italian. Did you
not know that? We Italians, we are many
things. Afraid? Never!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So Rosy presided at the switchboard. Each
night, during the hour that preceded Rosy&rsquo;s
departure and Johnny&rsquo;s taking up of his duties,
they enjoyed a chat about many, many
things.</p>
<p>Nor did Drew Lane object; for, as he one
night explained to Johnny, his relations with
the Ramacciottis were based on little more
than a charitable desire to be of service to
someone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">[108]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You have heard, I suppose,&rdquo; he said to
Johnny one evening, &ldquo;that there is a society
that looks after the families of policemen who
lose their lives in the service. That is a splendid
enterprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are also many societies in existence
that take care of the interests of criminals and
their families. That too, I suppose, is all right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But where is the society that cares for the
women and children made widows and orphans
by the bullets of gangsters, burglars,
and robbers? Never heard of one, did you?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, some of us fellows of the Force decided
to do what we could for these.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I learned of the Ramacciotti family. They
had inherited a small candy store and a large
debt. They were paying sixty dollars a month
flat rent, and going bankrupt rapidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I helped them sell out the store. Then I
found these two shacks. Used to be fishing
shacks, I suppose, twenty-five years ago. Tried
to find the owner. Couldn&rsquo;t. So we moved in
anyway. I pay for my room and morning coffee.
The furniture is Mrs. Ramacciotti&rsquo;s.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">[109]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I found her a small kitchen and dining
room down street, where she serves rare Italian
dishes, ravioli a la Tuscany and the like.
They are doing very well, and are happy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Happy. That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;Everyone
in the world has a right to be happy. It&rsquo;s our
duty, yours and mine, to be happy, and to do
the best we can to help others to their share
of happiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that was how Drew came to live in such
a strange place, and to be interested in these
unusual people.&rdquo; Johnny thought about this
for a long time after Drew had gone. His appreciation
of the character of this young detective
grew apace as he mused. His interest in
Rosy and her mother also increased.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">[110]</div>
<h2 id="c12"><br />CHAPTER XII
<br />FROM OUT THE SHADOWS</h2>
<p>Shortly after his discovery that the man
who wrecked his broadcasting corner and
beat him up was, in all probability, the robber
who had murdered Rosy&rsquo;s father, Johnny visited
Sergeant McCarthey at the police station.
As the days passed, this station was to become
a place of increasing fascination for this boy
who was interested in everything that had to
do with life, and who had a gnawing desire to
know all that is worth knowing.</p>
<p>This day, however, his interest was centered
on one question: What additional information
had the sergeant secured regarding the man
who had wrecked his station?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little enough, old son.&rdquo; The sergeant
leaned back as he spoke. &ldquo;Visited those pickpockets
in the jail. If they know anything
about the affair, their lips are sealed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">[111]</div>
<p>&ldquo;As for those young chaps, caught looting
a house, they promise even less. Won&rsquo;t tell a
thing about themselves; names, addresses,
nothing. They&rsquo;re not foreigners. American
stock, I&rsquo;d say. It&rsquo;s my guess that they had
nothing to do with your radio affair. They
appear to be boys from out of town. Some of
those chaps who read cheap detective stories
that make the criminal a hero. Came to this
city to crash into crime. Got caught. And now
they&rsquo;ll take what&rsquo;s given to them rather than
disgrace their families. Can&rsquo;t help but admire
their grit. But the pity of it all! To think that
any boy of to-day should come to look upon
crime as offering a career of romance and daring!
If only they could know the professional
criminal as we do, could see him as a cold-blooded
brute who cares only for himself, who
stops at nothing to gain his ends, who lives
for flash, glitter and sham, a man utterly devoid
of honor who will double-cross his most
intimate friend and put a pal on the spot or
take him for a ride if he believes he is too weak
to stand the test and not talk if he is caught.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">[112]</div>
<p>Then Johnny spoke. He told of the murder
of Rosy&rsquo;s father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did? The same man!&rdquo; The sergeant
sat up straight and stared as Johnny finished.
&ldquo;The man with the hole in his hand shot
Rosy&rsquo;s father?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me think.&rdquo; He cupped his chin in his
hands. &ldquo;I worked on that case. Didn&rsquo;t get a
clue. There was just one thing. After Rosy&rsquo;s
father had been shot, this man fired a shot into
the wall. Bullet&rsquo;s there still, I suppose. Few
crooks would do that. Likes noise, I suppose,
the sound of his gun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know,&rdquo; he explained, &ldquo;we are always
studying the peculiarities of bad men. It pays.
You know how a poker player judges men.
When his opponent has a good hand, he looks
just so, from beneath his eyelashes, or his fingers
drum the table, so. But if his hand is
bad, and he&rsquo;s bluffing, he looks away, whistles
a tune, does some other little thing that betrays
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">[113]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is that way with the crook. Each man
has some little tell-tale action which brands
each job he pulls. One man never speaks; he
writes out his orders. Another whispers. A
third shouts excitedly. One is polite to his
victims, especially the ladies. Another is brutal;
he binds them, gags them, even beats
them. Some prefer silence; some, noise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would seem,&rdquo; he sat up to drum on the
desk, &ldquo;that our friend with the hole in his hand
likes the sound of his gun. He fired an unnecessary
shot in the Ramacciotti case, and one
when he raided your studio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said with a sigh, &ldquo;all we have to
do is to search the records of crimes committed
in this city and see if we can find other raids
and stick-ups to lay at this man&rsquo;s door. Of
course, if the perpetrator of other crimes fired
his gun needlessly, it will not prove that Mr.
Hole-in-the-Hand did it, but it will point in
that direction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That bit of research will take some time.
I&rsquo;ll let you know what I find.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In those other cases of that night, the safe-blowing
and theatre robbery, was there any
unnecessary shooting?&rdquo; Johnny asked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">[114]</div>
<p>&ldquo;None reported. But then, of course, it is
not likely that Mr. Hole-in-the-Hand was on
the scene in either case. He was busy with
you. If he was in on either of these, the work
was done by his gang, not by him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That night a curious and startling thing
happened. This affair, as Herman McCarthey
agreed later, might or might not have a bearing
on the problem just discussed.</p>
<p>The detective team of Drew and Howe
worked for the most part during the daylight
hours. They were assigned to the task of detecting
and arresting pickpockets. If you rode
a crowded street car, attended a league baseball
game, or chanced to be on the edge of a
crowd drawn together on the street corner by
a vender of patent medicine or unbreakable
combs, you might easily sight the nifty hat
and flaming tie of Drew Lane, the natty detective.
They knew more than three hundred
pickpockets by sight, did this young pair. They
picked up any of these on suspicion if they
were found in a likely spot, and at once haled
them into court.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">[115]</div>
<p>This permanent assignment left Drew with
his evenings free. Because of this, he and
Johnny enjoyed many a night stroll together.</p>
<p>One of their favorite haunts was a slip which
ended some four blocks from their shack, and
extended for several blocks east until it lost
itself in the waters of the lake. This narrow
channel of water was lined on one side by
great bulging, empty sheet iron sheds, and on
the other by brick warehouses which appeared
equally empty. A narrow landing extending
the length of the sheds, and fast falling into
decay, offered a precarious footing for any who
chose to wander there.</p>
<p>It was a spooky place, this slip at night. At
the end nearest the shore, half under water,
half above, a one-time pleasure yacht lay rotting
away. At the far end, an ancient tug
fretted at a chain that was red with rust and
from time to time added to the general melancholy
of the place a hollow bub-bub as it
bumped the shore.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">[116]</div>
<p>One would scarcely say that a horde of gigantic
red-eyed rats could add to the attractions
or any place, let alone one such as this.
Lend it a touch of joy, they did, nevertheless.
This became Johnny&rsquo;s hunting ground. Armed
with his bow and quiver of arrows, he stalked
rats as in other climes he had stalked wolves
and bears.</p>
<p>Drew never tired of seeing his keen bladed
arrow speed straight and true. There is a certain
fascination about such expert marksmanship.
Besides, Drew hated rats. He had said
many times, &ldquo;A great city has two scourges,
professional criminals and rats. It&rsquo;s every honest
man&rsquo;s duty to help rid the city of both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On this particular night Johnny and Drew
had gone on one of their hunting trips. They
had put out a lure of shelled corn during the
day. Game was plentiful. In the half light of
the smoke-dulled moon, many a rodent whose
eyes gleamed in the dark met his death.</p>
<p>Drew had tired of the sport and had walked
a dozen paces down the way. Johnny was lurking
in the shadows, hoping for one more good
shot, when he thought he heard a curious
sound. This sound appeared to come from the
shadows opposite the spot where Drew, unconscious
of any danger, walked in the moonlight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">[117]</div>
<p>Then, of a sudden, a terrifying thing began
to happen. A hand and half an arm emerged
from the shadows that lay against the rotting
shed. In the hand was a gun. This gun was
rising slowly, steadily to a position where it
would be covering Drew.</p>
<p>What was to be done? Johnny&rsquo;s mind
worked with the lightning rapidity of a speed
camera.</p>
<p>Should he shout a warning? There was not
time. Leap forward? This too would be futile.
One thing remained. The movement of
that hand was slow, sure. Johnny&rsquo;s fingers
were fast as the speed of light. He nocked an
arrow, took sudden aim, and let fly. &ldquo;Silent
Murder&rdquo; found his mark.</p>
<p>Came a low cry of surprise, then a thud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Drew whirled about and snatched for his
own gun.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">[118]</div>
<p>Johnny did not dare answer. What had he
accomplished? Where was the hand, the gun,
the man? Nocking a second arrow, he crowded
further into the shadows. What was to
come next? His heart pounded hard against
his ribs.</p>
<p>Ten seconds passed, twenty, thirty.</p>
<p>With gun drawn, Drew advanced toward
him. Johnny expected at any moment to hear
a shot ring out. None did.</p>
<p>Once more Drew demanded, &ldquo;What was
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I-I saw a hand, half an arm, a-a gun,&rdquo;
Johnny stammered. &ldquo;I shot&mdash;shot an arrow
at the arm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hand, an arm, a gun?&rdquo; Drew was plainly
bewildered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gun was aimed at you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There. Over there in the shadows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gripping his gun tight, Drew threw the
light of his electric torch into those shadows.
&ldquo;No one there,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;You were
dreaming. But no. I heard something.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">[119]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And look!&rdquo; he cried, springing forward.
&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the gun. He dropped it. Fled. Thought
the Devil was after him. No wonder, when
you hunted him with &lsquo;Silent Murder.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I say, boy!&rdquo; he exclaimed, gripping
Johnny&rsquo;s hand till it hurt. &ldquo;You saved my life.
I&rsquo;ll not forget that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll just take this along,&rdquo; he said a moment
later as he picked up a steel blue sixshooter
with a six inch barrel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A forty-five,&rdquo; he said, turning it over. &ldquo;Not
a bad gun. And full of slugs. Reminds me of
one that nearly did for me once. Tell you
about it sometime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that they turned and walked quietly away
from the scene of the near tragedy.</p>
<p>Where was the intruder? Gone. What of
Johnny&rsquo;s arrow? What damage had it done?
Perhaps the light of day would answer some
of these questions. At present it was time for
Johnny to hasten away to his nightly vigil in
the squad call corner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">[120]</div>
<h2 id="c13"><br />CHAPTER XIII
<br />A MARKED MAN</h2>
<p>Johnny&rsquo;s work at the studio never failed
to fascinate him. The noon hours were
pure routine. But at night, when squad calls
came thick and fast&mdash;that was the time!</p>
<p>An entire symphony orchestra might be
crashing its way through some magnificent
concerto. No matter. The squad operator
spoke a few words in Johnny&rsquo;s ear. He jotted
down those words. He pressed a button twice.
For one brief second the air, a thousand miles
around, grew tensely silent. Then <i>Clang!
Clang! Clang!</i> And after that, Johnny&rsquo;s voice:
&ldquo;Squads, attention! Squad 16. A shooting
at Madison and Ashland.&rdquo; Ah! There was
power for you; a little press of a button and
all the world stood by.</p>
<p>Each night brought to his ears a terse description
of some new form of violence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">[121]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d think,&rdquo; he said to Drew once, &ldquo;that
the whole city had turned criminal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it hasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Drew replied thoughtfully.
&ldquo;Only one person in three hundred is a professional
criminal. Don&rsquo;t forget that. If you want
to know what that means, go somewhere and
watch a turnstile. Count three hundred people
as they pass through. Then say &lsquo;ONE.&rsquo; Big,
like that. That stands for one crook. Then
begin all over again, and count three hundred.&rdquo;
Johnny tried that, and derived a deal of assurance
from the experiment. It gave him the
comforting feeling that one might have who
has three hundred friends arrayed solidly behind
him, row on row, while a single enemy
stands across the way.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">[122]</div>
<p>But were these truly ready to stand back of
law and justice? &ldquo;If they are not,&rdquo; he told
himself, &ldquo;it is because of ignorance. If they
do not know the truth they must be told.&rdquo;
Johnny hurried back to the shack as soon as
his work was done, on the night of his curious
adventure down by the slip. He had no desire
to go prowling about those abandoned sheds
again that night. He did wish to be abroad
the first thing in the morning. He wanted to
discover, if possible, how the would-be assassin
had made his escape. He was also curious to
discover whether or not his arrow had gone
with the stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am surprised that anyone should attempt
to kill me,&rdquo; Drew said, as they started for the
slip early that morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But isn&rsquo;t a police officer&rsquo;s life always in
danger?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, no, I wouldn&rsquo;t say so. Depends, of
course, on your record, and the type of crooks
you are assigned to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take the matter of arresting a crook. He
doesn&rsquo;t usually resist, unless you&rsquo;ve caught him
red-handed in crime. Rather take a chance
with the judge. Figures you&rsquo;ve got nothing
on him anyway. And I haven&rsquo;t been in on anything
really big. They give those things to
older men. Howe and I have been following
pickpockets for months. That was my first
and it&rsquo;s my last assignment as a detective so
far.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">[123]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Pickpockets are seldom violent. Sneaking
is their game. They seldom pack a gun. If
they do, they don&rsquo;t know how to use it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That man knew his gun,&rdquo; said Johnny with
a shudder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fairly good gun.&rdquo; Drew had thrown the
cartridges out of the revolver. He had hung it
on a nail over the head of his bed. There it
was destined to remain until a busy spider had
spun a web about it and built him a gauzy
home inside the trigger guard. For all that,
neither the spider, the revolver, nor the former
owner of the revolver were destined to rest
long in peace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s plain enough,&rdquo; said Johnny, as they
reached the sheds, &ldquo;why that assassin was
unconscious of my presence. I had been standing
silently in the shadows, a long time, looking
for a rat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; chuckled Drew, &ldquo;you got one, didn&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been wondering,&rdquo; replied
Johnny. &ldquo;Probably I did; otherwise why did
he drop the gun?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">[124]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Quite so. You traded an arrow for a loaded
gun. Not so bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I still have hope of recovering my arrow.
The flesh of a man&rsquo;s arm is a thin target. I
put all I had into that shot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They found some footprints ground into the
cinders where the man had stood. They discovered
several breaks in the rusting sides of
the shed, where he might have escaped. And
yes, true to Johnny&rsquo;s expectations, they found
the arrow where it had spent its force and
dropped a hundred or more feet from the spot
from which it had been fired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See!&rdquo; exclaimed Johnny as he picked it up.
&ldquo;I got him. Blood on the feathers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never doubted that for a moment,&rdquo; Drew
said impressively. &ldquo;As you suggested, the arrow
must have gone through the fleshy part
of his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a marked man!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;You
must keep that arrow. Some day, perhaps to-morrow,
perhaps ten years from now, it may
be needed as evidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">[125]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That arrow mark will leave a scar that
matches the width of your arrow blade. It will
have other peculiarities that will tell straight
and plain that the wound was made, not only
by an arrow, but by one arrow&mdash;this one. I&rsquo;ve
seen things far more technical than that, far
more difficult to prove, sway a jury and win
a hanging verdict.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, in the end, the arrow was laid across
two nails close to the revolver above Drew&rsquo;s
bed.</p>
<p>And, just by way of providing an easy
means of escape if escape were necessary, the
spider ran a line from the thug&rsquo;s revolver to
Johnny&rsquo;s blood-dyed arrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said something about boxing once,&rdquo;
Drew was at the door of the shack, ready to
depart for his day of scouting. &ldquo;How&rsquo;d you
like to meet me at the club this evening for a
few rounds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be great!&rdquo; Johnny exclaimed enthusiastically.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll find me rusty, though. Haven&rsquo;t
had gloves on for a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">[126]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the address.&rdquo; Drew wrote on a bit
of paper, and handed it to Johnny. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll meet
you in the lobby at nine o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With Drew gone, and only the distant rumble
of the city to keep him company, Johnny
sat down in Drew&rsquo;s rocking chair to think.
From time to time his gaze strayed to the wall
where the revolver and the arrow hung.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Life,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;has grown more complicated
and&mdash;and more terrible. And yet, what
a privilege it is to live!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the first time since he arrived on that
freighter at midnight, he felt a desire to be
far, far away from this great city and all that
it stood for.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Power,&rdquo; he murmured, &ldquo;great power, that
is what a city stands for. Great power, great
weakness, great success, gigantic failure, men
of magnificent character, men of no character
at all; that&rsquo;s what you find in a city of three
million people.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">[127]</div>
<p>At once his mind was far away. In his imagination
he stood upon a small and shabby dock.
A small and shabby village lay at the back of
the dock. At his feet a dilapidated clinker-built
rowboat bumped the dock. Oars were
there, minnows for bait, and fishing tackle.
Two miles up the bay was a dark hole where
great muskies waved the water with their fins,
where bass black as coal darted from place to
place, while spotted perch, seeming part of the
water itself, hung motionless, watching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, to be there!&rdquo; he breathed. &ldquo;The peace,
the simple joy of it all. To drop a minnow
down there; to cast one far out, then to watch
for the move that means a strike!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet&mdash;&rdquo; He sighed, but did not finish
his sentence. On the youth of to-day a great
city exerts an indescribable charm. Johnny
would not leave this city of his boyhood days
until he had conquered or had been conquered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s strange, all this,&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;Wonder
why that man beat me up there in the studio?
Wonder if Sergeant McCarthey knows any
more than he did. Let me see. Pickpockets,
boy robbers, theatre holdup men, safe blowers.
Wonder whose accomplice that man with
a hole in his hand is. Who can tell?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">[128]</div>
<h2 id="c14"><br />CHAPTER XIV
<br />JOHNNY SCORES A KNOCKDOWN</h2>
<p>Johnny experienced no difficulty in locating
Drew&rsquo;s club. It was a fine place, that
club; small, but very useful. Not much space
for loafing there; a lobby, that was all. A
completely equipped gymnasium, showers, a
swimming pool, bowling alleys in the basement,
a floor for boxing and fencing. A young
men&rsquo;s club this was, with a purpose. That
purpose was set up in large letters above the
desk in the lobby: KEEP FIT.</p>
<p>In a surprisingly short time they had undressed,
passed under the showers, gone
through a quick rub-down, drawn on shorts
and gloves, and there they were.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">[129]</div>
<p>Drew was five years Johnny&rsquo;s senior. He
was taller almost by a head, and thirty pounds
heavier. It seemed an uneven match. But
Johnny was well built. Then, too, he had a passion
for boxing that dated back to his sixth
year. When at that early date a boy three
years his senior had taken it upon himself to
put Johnny in his place, Johnny had emerged
from the engagement bloody, tattered and victorious.</p>
<p>For a space of five minutes these two,
Johnny and Drew, sparred, getting up their
wind and landing comfortable body blows now
and then. When they sat down for a brief
blowing spell, Drew looked Johnny over with
increased admiration. He had expected to
amuse this boy and get a little workout for
himself. He had found that Johnny was quick
on his feet, that his eyes were good, and that
his left carried a punch that came with the
speed of chain lightning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was going to give you a little sermon
on keeping fit,&rdquo; Drew said after a moment of
silence. &ldquo;Guess you don&rsquo;t need it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everyone needs it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You bet they do. Hadn&rsquo;t been for my
keeping fit, I wouldn&rsquo;t be here at all. Come on.
Let&rsquo;s go another round.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">[130]</div>
<p>Once more they sparred. This time Drew
seemed determined to deal Johnny at least
one smacker on the face. In this he was singularly
unsuccessful. Johnny was never there
when the blow arrived. He ducked; he wove
right, wove left, sprang backward, spun round.</p>
<p>Then of a sudden, something happened. In
making a desperate effort to reach Johnny&rsquo;s
chin, Drew exposed the left side of his face.
Johnny swung hard, but planned to pull the
punch. Drew suddenly leaned into it.
Johnny&rsquo;s blow came in with the impact of a
trip hammer, just under Drew&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<p>Drew dropped like an empty sack.</p>
<p>He was out for the count of five. Then he
sat up dizzily, stared about him, caught
Johnny&rsquo;s eyes, then grinned a crooked grin
that lacked nothing of sincerity as he exclaimed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a darb!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Half an hour later, after a second shower,
the two boys sat in the small lunch room of
the club, munching cold tongue sandwiches
on rye, and drinking coffee.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">[131]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Boy!&rdquo; said Drew. &ldquo;You should train for
the ring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t interest me,&rdquo; said Johnny. &ldquo;Fine
thing to box, just to keep fit. But when it
comes to making a business of a thing that
should be all pure fun&mdash;not for me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess you&rsquo;re right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But tell me,&rdquo; said Johnny. &ldquo;Is it hard to
become a city detective?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so easy. Many a fellow out in the
sticks pounding a beat would like to be on the
detective force. It&rsquo;s more dangerous. But
you have more freedom. And you get a bigger
kick out of it. If you get there quick you&rsquo;ve
got to get a break. I got a break.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Queer sort of thing,&rdquo; he mused as one will
who is about to spin a yarn. &ldquo;I was off duty,
dressed in knickers, driving home in my car,
with a friend, from a golf game. Traffic light
stopped us. Fellow, tough looking egg, stuck
a cannon in my face and said: &lsquo;Stick &rsquo;em up!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you do?&rdquo; Johnny leaned forward
eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would you have done?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">[132]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t on duty. Weren&rsquo;t wearing
your star?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not wearing my star, that&rsquo;s right. But in
a way an officer of the law is never off duty.
Many a brave fellow has been killed because
he stepped into something when he was in
civilian clothes and off duty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friend that was with me was a real
guy. He wouldn&rsquo;t have squawked if I had
given that bad egg my money and driven on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you know, that&rsquo;s not the way a fellow&rsquo;s
mind works. No, sir! You say to yourself,
&lsquo;This guy&rsquo;s got the drop on me. I&rsquo;ve got to
get him. How&rsquo;ll I do it?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you do?&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s coffee was
cooling on the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said, &lsquo;Please, Mister, don&rsquo;t shoot me.
I&rsquo;m a young fellow. I don&rsquo;t want to die. I&rsquo;ll
give you everything, but don&rsquo;t shoot!&rsquo; Stalling
for time. See?</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;All right,&rsquo; he growled, &lsquo;back the car into
the alley.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He climbed into the back seat and pressed
cold steel against the back of my neck.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">[133]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I had to look through the rear
window to back into the alley. That gave me
an idea. I blinked my eyes as if I saw someone
behind the car. He was nervous. They
generally are. Who wouldn&rsquo;t be?</p>
<p>&ldquo;He turned his head to look back. I had a
small 32 in my pocket. I whipped it out and
took a pot shot at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My hand struck the back of the seat. The
gun flew up. I missed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He whirled about and put his gun on my
temple. &lsquo;You murderin&rsquo; &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;,&rsquo; he said,
and pulled the trigger three times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gun didn&rsquo;t go off.&rdquo; Drew paused to
smile. &ldquo;Sometimes a fellow gets a break that
makes him want to believe in angels and
things like that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That gun was loaded with slugs. It had
a lock on it. He had failed to release the lock.
He threw away his gun and grabbed for mine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We grappled, and I went over the seat on
top of him, shouting to my friend: &lsquo;Go call
the police.&rsquo; He went.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">[134]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then we fought it out there alone. That&rsquo;s
where keeping fit came in. He was a tough
egg with a record long as your arm. He was
strong. He was desperate. The &lsquo;stir&rsquo; craze
was on him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Don&rsquo;t resist me,&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m an officer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll kill you with your own gun if it&rsquo;s the
last thing I ever do!&rsquo; That was his answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We fought and struggled. He banged me
here. He banged me there. He bit my hand
to the bone. Once he pressed my own gun
to my head, but my finger was on the trigger.
He couldn&rsquo;t shoot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Pull the trigger, &mdash;&mdash; &mdash;&mdash; you! Pull the
trigger. It&rsquo;s on your head!&rsquo; That&rsquo;s what he
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A stranger heard the noise and came to
look at us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Call the police!&rsquo; I yelled. &lsquo;Call the police!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should have heard him hot-footing
out of there! I tell you that was funny!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And then we bumped into the door. It
flew open. We tumbled out. I got my chance.
I fired one shot. I got my man.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">[135]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hey, waiter!&rdquo; Drew called with a smile.
&ldquo;Bring us some more coffee. This has gone
cold.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he said thoughtfully, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s
always too bad when a man has to die. But
it was one or the other of us. He wasn&rsquo;t much
good. They wanted him for a dozen robberies,
and for shooting a policeman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was in the sticks walking a beat then.
They gave me a job on the detective force,
and I received a hundred dollars reward from
one of the papers. So you see, life as a copper
isn&rsquo;t so bad, providing you get the breaks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Johnny said slowly, &ldquo;Providing you
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; said Drew after stirring his
coffee reflectively for a time, &ldquo;that I should
be satisfied. And I am, reasonably so. But
you know, pickpockets are very small game.
It&rsquo;s necessary enough that they should be
mopped up. But it&rsquo;s like hunting rabbits
when there are grizzly bears about. I&rsquo;d like
to get in on something big.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">[136]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Things are going to happen in this old
town. Judges are getting better. The prosecutors
are working harder. The honest people
are waking up. One of these fine days the
order will be given to break up every gang in
town; bring them in or drive them out. I
want to be in on that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will,&rdquo; said Johnny. &ldquo;They won&rsquo;t be
able to do it without you. They need a thousand
like you, a Legion of Youth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right!&rdquo; Drew put his cup down
with a crash. &ldquo;College men. That&rsquo;s what they
need. Men may sneer at them. They needn&rsquo;t.
I&rsquo;m a college man, and I&rsquo;m proud of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know what?&rdquo; His eyes shone. &ldquo;They are
going to put courses in criminology in the
colleges and universities. They&rsquo;ll do more
than that. They&rsquo;ll teach young fellows how
to be good detectives. Why not? They teach
them everything else. Why not that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will,&rdquo; said Johnny. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;d like to
take the course myself.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c15"><br />CHAPTER XV
<br />JOHNNY FINDS A MAN</h2>
<p>That night Sergeant McCarthey visited
Johnny in his cubby-hole by the big radio
studio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, boy,&rdquo; he said, putting out a big,
brown hand for a shake. &ldquo;Mind if I sit down
awhile? Sort of like to see how the calls go
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a bit,&rdquo; Johnny smiled. &ldquo;Glad to have
company. Little dull lately. Robbery, shooting,
burglary, shooting, holdup; that&rsquo;s about
the way it goes. Nothing really new.&rdquo; He
laughed a short laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say!&rdquo; the sergeant exclaimed, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got
to hand it to this old burg. That stuff goes
out all over the country. Everybody gets it.
And they say, &lsquo;What a terrible town!&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">[138]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s not a bad town. I&rsquo;ve lived in
others. I know. They&rsquo;re all alike. Difference
is, others cover it all up. We don&rsquo;t. You&rsquo;ll
see. When we shout enough, the crooks will
begin clearing out. You&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny held up a finger. He listened. He
wrote. He banged his gong. Then&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Squads attention! Squads 36 and 37.
Robbers in the second apartment at 1734 Wabash.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way it goes, is it?&rdquo; said the sergeant.
&ldquo;Pretty quick work. When we get
our own station it will be snappier. And only
the squad cars will get the calls. Special low
wave-length.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a time they sat in silence. Then Johnny&rsquo;s
telephone buzzed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another call?&rdquo; McCarthey asked in a low
tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just a report on that last call.&rdquo; Johnny&rsquo;s
eyes twinkled. &ldquo;Got &rsquo;em. Got &rsquo;em four minutes
after the call went out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good work. No wonder they hate you,
those crooks. This place should be guarded.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is.&rdquo; Johnny laid his hand on his bow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">[139]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Drew told me about that thing and the
way you handled it down there by the slip.
Wouldn&rsquo;t have believed it if he hadn&rsquo;t told
me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way, I&rsquo;ve been making a little study
of that man&rsquo;s history, the one who shot Rosy&rsquo;s
father, the one that beat you up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Find anything?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Following the hunch about his liking the
sound of his gun, and the descriptions given
in other robberies, I believe he&rsquo;s responsible
for several bad bits of business.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This much we know from the case of
Rosy&rsquo;s father. He&rsquo;s a Sicilian. A tall fellow,
and heavily built. Not dark for his race. Got
a low, narrow forehead, and blue eyes very
close together. He&rsquo;s never been caught.
Probably sneaked into our country from Canada
or Mexico. Send him back where he came
from if we get him. And we&rsquo;ll get him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; said Johnny, with a furtive
glance toward the door. &ldquo;I mostly manage to
keep wide awake. But it&rsquo;s late by the time I&rsquo;m
through. If I should get drowsy, and he
walked in again, well&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_140">[140]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This place should be guarded,&rdquo; the sergeant
repeated. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll suggest it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t bother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll lend you a gun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guns make such a lot of noise. Old Silent
Murder here will do as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;d better be going.&rdquo; Herman McCarthey
rose. &ldquo;Got to catch my train.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Train?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I live in the country. Little village;
one store, one church, post office, few homes.
Need the peace I find there to go with the
rush of the city and this business of hunting
crooks. It&rsquo;s good to wake up with a breath
of dew in your nostrils, and the robins singing
their morning song. Nothing like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Johnny, &ldquo;there isn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; He was
thinking of the woods by his fishing hole in
the far away North Peninsula, where the song
sparrows fairly burst their throats with
melody.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; said Johnny.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">[141]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good night, son.&rdquo; The sergeant was gone.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>The State Street Police Court with its humorous
Punch and Judy judge became a place
of great fascination to Johnny. In the past
he had dreamed of courts where trials dragged
through weary months; where prisoners languished
in jail; and a man might be sentenced
to five years of hard labor for stealing a loaf of
bread to feed a starving family. How different
was this court where a pretty lady might
steal a dress she did not need, and never go to
jail at all.</p>
<p>The very poor, Johnny soon learned, were
treated with consideration. Their poverty was
not forgotten.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; he said to Drew one day, &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t help but feel that there would be less
stealing if some of these first offenders
scrubbed a few floors in the workhouse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are many things to be considered,&rdquo;
was Drew&rsquo;s reply.</p>
<p>And then one day, as he stood in that State
Street court room, all eyes and ears for what
was taking place, Johnny made a great discovery.
He found a man.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_142">[142]</div>
<p>This man was not brought to court. He
came of his own accord, to plead the cause
of another.</p>
<p>He was not quite sober, this man; indeed
there are those who would have said he was
drunk. And yet he spoke with precision.</p>
<p>Though there was about him an indescribable
air of youth, this man&rsquo;s hair was white.
His face was thin. Some of his teeth were
gone. His clothes were well-worn, yet they
showed immaculate care. His linen was clean.
&ldquo;Shabby gentility&rdquo; partly described him; but
not quite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Judge,&rdquo; he said, tilting first on heels, then
on his toes, &ldquo;Judge, your Honor, you have a
man in jail here. He was fined twenty-five
dollars for being drunk.&rdquo; He paused for
breath. &ldquo;Judge, your Honor, he can&rsquo;t pay that
fine. He isn&rsquo;t a bad man, Judge. He drinks
too much sometimes, Judge. Let him go,
can&rsquo;t you, Judge?&rdquo; The man&rsquo;s voice took on a
pleading note.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s this man&rsquo;s name?&rdquo; The judge
studied the stranger&rsquo;s face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_143">[143]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Judge, your Honor, his name is Robert
MacCain. He isn&rsquo;t a bad man, Judge. Let
him go, will you, Judge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a pal of yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, your Honor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You drink with him sometimes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, your Honor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You took a little drink yesterday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, your Honor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And last night?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And last night. Yes, your Honor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How does it come you were not arrested
with this pal of yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Honor,&rdquo; again the stranger tilted
backward and forward from heel to toe, &ldquo;Your
Honor, I try at all times to be a gentleman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let him go, Judge. Will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you a lawyer?&rdquo; The judge leaned forward
to stare at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, your Honor. But I know more law
than your Swanson or Darrow or&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should have been a lawyer. What are
you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_144">[144]</div>
<p>Again the stranger went up on his toes.
&ldquo;Your Honor, for seventeen years I was a detective
on the police force of New York. I
ranked as a lieutenant, your Honor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This fellow is a romancer,&rdquo; Johnny whispered
to an attorney who stood beside him.
&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t know truth from lies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is telling the truth,&rdquo; was the astounding
reply. &ldquo;I know him. He was rated high.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lawyer scribbled a sentence on a slip
of paper. He handed it to the judge.</p>
<p>This movement did not escape the stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Honor,&rdquo; he pleaded, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t let any
of this get into the papers. I have a mother
eighty-six years old. It would kill her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Honor, my name is Newton Mills.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Newton Mills?&rdquo; The judge started, then
stared in unfeigned astonishment. &ldquo;You are
Newton Mills?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, your Honor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, your Honor.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_145">[145]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you are!&rdquo; The judge braced himself
on the arms of his chair. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re drinking
yourself to death. You are breaking your
mother&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ll do.&rdquo; He reached
for an order blank. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send you down there
with your pal. You&rsquo;ll have a chance to sober
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At once the face of Newton Mills became a
study in pain. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do that, Judge. Don&rsquo;t
do it. It will break my mother&rsquo;s heart. I
haven&rsquo;t done anything bad, Judge. I&rsquo;ll quit
drinking, Judge. I promise. Don&rsquo;t do it,
Judge. I&rsquo;ll quit. I promise, Judge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There had been a time when, quite a young
boy, Johnny Thompson had made friends
with a homeless dog. At another time he had
found a half grown kitten starving under a
barn. After much trouble he had caught the
kitten. It had scratched him terribly, but
he had clung to it and had carried it home to
give it a chance.</p>
<p>Something of the same feeling came over
him now. Only this time he had found, not
a dog, not a cat, but something more precious&mdash;a
man.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_146">[146]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;your Honor,&rdquo; he stammered, scarcely
knowing what he was saying, &ldquo;if your Honor
please, I&rsquo;d like this man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To what purpose?&rdquo; The judge stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To give him another chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you?&rdquo; Once more the judge leaned
far forward in his chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drew Lane is my friend. We live together.
With his help I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Done!&rdquo; said the judge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You heard what he said!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
turning to the astonished Newton Mills. &ldquo;You
promised to stop drinking. This young man
will see that you do stop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Never in all his life had Johnny seen such
a look of despair as came over the face of the
old-time detective. He had made that promise
a thousand times. He had never kept it.
Now here was someone with the mighty arm
of the law behind him, who said, &ldquo;You must!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He glanced wildly about the room, as if
looking for means of escape. Then with a look
of utter weariness he murmured:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, your Honor.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_147">[147]</div>
<h2 id="c16"><br />CHAPTER XVI
<br />THE FACE THAT SEEMED A MASK</h2>
<p>So it happened that when Drew returned
from work that evening he found a man in
Johnny&rsquo;s bunk, and Johnny seated near him.
The man was asleep, or in a drunken stupor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I found a man,&rdquo; said Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like a bum,&rdquo; said Drew, casting a
critical eye over the stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has been.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like he was drunk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why&mdash;&rdquo; Drew paused to stare at
the stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drew,&rdquo; said Johnny, almost solemnly, &ldquo;did
you ever hear of Newton Mills?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Newton Mills, the great city detective?
Who hasn&rsquo;t?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; said Johnny dramatically, &ldquo;is Newton
Mills.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_148">[148]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; Drew took a step forward. &ldquo;It
can&rsquo;t be. He disappeared three years ago.
He&rsquo;s dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet&mdash;&rdquo; He stared at the face of the
man on the cot.</p>
<p>Then he tore into a trunk to drag out a
bundle of old photographs. One of these he
studied intently for a moment. Then turning
to Johnny, he said in a voice tense with emotion,</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Johnny, that is Newton Mills. You
have indeed found a man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; he exclaimed in an altered tone.
&ldquo;I wonder if that&rsquo;s the price? Will I be like
that in twenty years?&rdquo;</p>
<p>To this question he expected no reply. He
received none.</p>
<p>He took a seat beside the cot where the
man with deep-lined face and tangled white
hair was sleeping. For a long time he said
nothing. Silence brooded over the shack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This man, Drew Lane, is an unusual person,&rdquo;
Johnny told himself. &ldquo;He is so full of
strange deep thoughts.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">[149]</div>
<p>This beyond question was true. He was
given to actions quite as strange as his
thoughts. At one time he had paid a half-dollar
for the privilege of taking Johnny to
the top of his city&rsquo;s highest tower. Once
there, he had spread his hands wide as he exclaimed,
&ldquo;See, Johnny! Look at all that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was indeed an awe-inspiring sight. Mile
on mile of magnificent buildings. Towers rising
to the clouds, all the wealth and glory of
a great modern city was there, spread out beneath
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny,&rdquo; Drew had said, &ldquo;there are people
living down there who are ashamed of their
own city. They don&rsquo;t believe in its future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t blame them too much.&rdquo; His
voice took on a note of sadness. &ldquo;The badness
of it is pretty terrible.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But think, Johnny! Look! Look and
think how many men of great wealth must
have believed in this city and her future. Not
one of those great towers could have risen
a foot from the ground had not some man had
faith in the city&rsquo;s future.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_150">[150]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And, Johnny!&rdquo; He had gripped the boy&rsquo;s
arm hard. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s my task and yours, every
young man&rsquo;s task, to prove to the world that
the faith of those men was not misplaced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we will!&rdquo; He had clenched his hands
tight. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll make it the grandest, the greatest,
the safest, most beautiful city the world
has ever known!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had said that. And now he sat brooding
beside the form of one who, like himself
perhaps in his youth, had thrown himself
against the slow revolving wheel of stone that
is a great city&rsquo;s appalling wickedness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now see!&rdquo; he murmured, half aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lawyer who told me who he was said
he was &lsquo;just a shell!&rsquo;&rdquo; Johnny volunteered.
&ldquo;Do you think you can make anything of
just a shell?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; Drew&rsquo;s tone betrayed no
emotion. &ldquo;But who could do less than try?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; Johnny echoed.</p>
<p>At that moment the souls of Drew and
Johnny were like those of David and Jonathan.
They were as one.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_151">[151]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That man,&rdquo; said Drew as he nodded at the
slight form on the cot, &ldquo;was one of New
York&rsquo;s finest. Many a member of the old Five
Point Gang has felt a light touch on his arm,
to turn and laugh up into those mild blue eyes.
But they never laughed long. That touch became
a chain of steel. The chain dragged
them to a cell or to a grave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are people still,&rdquo; he rambled on,
&ldquo;who believe that a detective should be a man
of muscle and brawn. In a fight, of course,
it helps. But in these days when fighting is
done, for the most part, with powder and steel,
a slight man with brains gets the break. This
Newton Mills surely did. For a long, long
time he got all the breaks. But now look!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He told the judge he had been living on
fifteen dollars a week, sent by his mother,&rdquo;
said Johnny. &ldquo;What could have happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many things perhaps. Herman McCarthey
will know. I have heard him speak of Newton
Mills. We will ask him, first thing to-morrow
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And there, for a time, the matter rested.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">[152]</div>
<p>That night as he went to work, walking by
preference down the Avenue, then over the
Drive that fronted the lake, as one will at
times, Johnny received the impression that he
was being watched, perhaps followed.</p>
<p>An uncomfortable feeling this, at any time.
A late hour, a deserted street, do not lessen
one&rsquo;s mental disturbance.</p>
<p>Long ago Johnny had formed two habits.
While walking alone at night he kept well
toward the outer edge of the sidewalk. Under
such conditions it is hard for a would-be assailant
to spring at one unobserved. Then,
too, he carried one hand in his coat pocket.
&ldquo;For,&rdquo; he was accustomed to say to his friends,
&ldquo;who will know what I hold in that hand? It
may be a small gun. If it were, I could shoot
it quite accurately without removing it from
my pocket. Crooks are, at heart, great cowards.
What one of them will face a hand in
a coat pocket?&rdquo; Thus far in Johnny&rsquo;s young
life, not one of the night prowlers had molested
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_153">[153]</div>
<p>Though some sixth sense told him now that
he was being followed in the shadows, he was
not greatly alarmed. He merely increased his
pace to a brisk walk. From time to time he
looked over his shoulder. Each time he saw
no one.</p>
<p>He was passing along an empty lot lined
with great signboards, and had reached the
center of the block when two men sprang from
the shadows.</p>
<p>Not wholly unprepared for this, he gave a
sudden leap to one side, then sprang forward
to transform the affair into a foot race.</p>
<p>Fortunately at that moment four sturdy citizens
turned a corner and advanced in his direction.</p>
<p>This apparently was an unforeseen part of
the program, for at once his would-be assailants
stopped short, then turned as if to walk
in the other direction.</p>
<p>As they turned, the face of the shorter one
was suddenly illumined by a light from an
auto that had turned a corner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_154">[154]</div>
<p>It was but a flash. Then all was darkness.
Yet in that flash Johnny had seen a man, one
of those who had followed him. He was a
youth with broad, slightly stooping shoulders.
His face seemed a mask. His clothes were in
the height of style. The light brought a flash
from a diamond somewhere on his person.</p>
<p>Darkness followed. Johnny walked straight
ahead. He met and passed the four men, who
paid him not the slightest attention. Fifteen
minutes later he was at his post in the radio
station. There, for a time, the matter ended.
Of two things you may be sure. Johnny
walked that street no more at night, nor did
he forget that youth with a face that was like
a mask.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_155">[155]</div>
<h2 id="c17"><br />CHAPTER XVII
<br />THE SERGEANT&rsquo;S STORY</h2>
<p>When Johnny returned to the shack that
night his strange guest was still
asleep. A third cot had been set up in the
room. Understanding this, Johnny crept between
the fresh, clean-feeling sheets, and was
soon sleeping soundly.</p>
<p>When he awoke in the morning Drew was
gone. His white-haired guest, Newton Mills,
the man he had found, was seated on his bunk,
chin cupped in hands, staring at the floor.</p>
<p>Johnny lay in his bunk watching him for a
full quarter of an hour. In all that time he did
not move so much as a finger.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">[156]</div>
<p>This man fascinated Johnny. Does this
seem strange? Who has not dreamed of coming
upon a derelict at sea; of seeing her masts
broken, bridge and gunwale gone, decks
awash, yet carrying on, the wreck of a one-time
magnificent craft? Could such a sight fail
to bring to the lips an awe-inspired cry? How
much more the wreck of a great man?</p>
<p>But was this a true derelict? This was the
question that pressed itself upon Johnny&rsquo;s
eager young mind. Many a drifting hulk,
having been found sound of beam and keel,
has been towed ashore to be refitted and sail
the seas once more. So, too, it is with men.
Thus Johnny&rsquo;s thoughts rambled on.</p>
<p>But what of this strange, prematurely gray
man? What thoughts filled his mind at this
hour? Or did he think?</p>
<p>Rousing himself, Johnny stepped from his
bed, donned shirt, trousers and slippers to
glide from the room and knock at that other
door. Into Rosy&rsquo;s ready ear he whispered:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coffee for two. Stout! Black and strong!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A short time later as he and the one-time
great detective drank hot black coffee in silence,
the door opened and Herman McCarthey
entered. Johnny understood in an instant.
Drew had sent him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">[157]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hello, Mills!&rdquo; the sergeant exclaimed
heartily. &ldquo;Remember me, don&rsquo;t you? We
worked together on the Romeri kidnapping
case. That was, let me see, twelve years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Romeri.&rdquo; The man passed a hand before
his face, as one will who brushes away a cobweb.
&ldquo;Romeri. Yes, I remember the case.
And you, Herman McCarthey. Ah yes, Herman
McCarthey. There were no stool pigeons
in that case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Herman, &ldquo;there were none.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Conversation lagged. Herman sat down to
drink a cup of coffee. He sighed, got up,
walked across the floor, and sat down again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell you what,&rdquo; he said at last, looking at
Johnny. &ldquo;To-day&rsquo;s my day off. Going out
to my place at Mayfair. It&rsquo;s quiet out there
and mighty fine. To-morrow&rsquo;s Sunday. Supposing
I take Mills out there for the week-end.
You come out Sunday and stay all night.
Then we&rsquo;ll come back to town in my car, the
three of us. What do you say, Mills?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The white-haired man rose with the air of
one who has surrendered his will; like a
prisoner who receives orders from a guard.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">[158]</div>
<p>Herman McCarthey read the meaning of
that act, and frowned. He did not, however,
say, &ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s not go.&rdquo; He said nothing, but
led the way. The other followed.</p>
<p>Johnny went with them to the sidewalk.
There he stood and watched them board a
west bound car. After that he turned about
and walked thoughtfully back to the room. In
his mind questions turned themselves over
and over. &ldquo;When is a man an empty shell?
When is he a hopeless derelict?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He thought of Herman McCarthey, alone
out there at his country place with that terribly
silent man, and was tempted to regret the
steps he had taken.</p>
<p>He ended by drinking a second cup of coffee,
then falling asleep in his chair.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>Next day Johnny went out to Herman McCarthey&rsquo;s
place. He had no trouble finding
the house. The town was small, only a tiny
village, but filled with many stately trees.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">[159]</div>
<p>He wondered a little as he walked up the
gravel path. How was his man, his derelict?
Would anything worth while come of this affair?</p>
<p>He found Newton Mills in the same condition
as when he left the shack. He talked
little, always of trivial matters. He ate almost
nothing. At times a haunting desire was written
on his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Been like that all the time,&rdquo; Herman whispered
to Johnny. &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t tell how he&rsquo;ll come
out. Seen many like him. Can&rsquo;t help it when
you&rsquo;re a cop. They&rsquo;re like a lamp that&rsquo;s been
burning a long time and gone dim. Some, if
you give them a fresh supply of oil, flare up,
then burn steadily again. Some don&rsquo;t. Last
spark is gone. How about him? Who knows?
Only God knows. We must do our best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They spent the day in quiet rambles about
the village and long periods of loafing on the
porch.</p>
<p>Newton Mills retired early. That left Herman
and Johnny to amuse themselves; not
that the strange derelict had furnished them
much amusement. In his bed at least he was
no longer a burden.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_160">[160]</div>
<p>The two, the seasoned detective and the
boy, chose to sit the long evening through on
the broad screened porch.</p>
<p>The still peace of the place seemed strange
to the boy whose ears had become accustomed
to the rattle of elevated trains, the shouts of
newsboys and the miscellaneous din of a city&rsquo;s
streets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so quiet,&rdquo; he said, looking away
through the motionless leaves of stately trees,
across the darkened lawn to the spot where
the moon was rising.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Herman McCarthey, &ldquo;it is quiet.
Sometimes I like to feel that the peace of God
hovers over the spot. Anyway, it&rsquo;s the only
place I&rsquo;ll ever live.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, of course, that you&rsquo;re supposed
to live in Chicago if you&rsquo;re on the force,&rdquo; he
went on. &ldquo;But the Chief fixed that for me.
It&rsquo;s only a rule; not a law.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Chief and I,&rdquo; and his tone became reminiscent,
&ldquo;were on the force together when we
were young. We were in one fight which the
Chief won&rsquo;t forget. Nor I, either.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">[161]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There was a tough gang down by the river.
A shooting had been reported. We got there
on the double-quick; too quick perhaps. We
met &rsquo;em coming up the bank, all armed.
They didn&rsquo;t wait for words. Just started in
shooting. They got me in the shoulder first
round. But I stood up to &rsquo;em and let &rsquo;em have
it back. So did the Chief. One man went
down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of a sudden the bullet I had in me made
me dizzy. I spun round and went down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Chief stood up to &rsquo;em. A dozen rounds
were fired before my head cleared. When it
did, I propped my eyes open just in time to see
one of them bending over the Chief, taking
deadly aim. The Chief was down with a bullet
in his back. That shot never was fired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;you got him.&rdquo; It was Johnny who
spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said it, son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that,&rdquo; said Herman McCarthey, &ldquo;is
why the Chief lets me live where I please.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_162">[162]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But that,&rdquo; he went on after a moment, &ldquo;is
not why I live here. Of course I&rsquo;ve always
loved the quiet peace of the open country. You
need it after the day&rsquo;s rush and noise and all
the squalid fuss you endure as a police officer.
Somehow I have a notion that if a lot more
of those city cave-dwellers lived out in places
like this we wouldn&rsquo;t have so many to run
down and put in jail. But who knows?</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the whole reason either.&rdquo; He
leaned forward in his chair. &ldquo;I live here because
it&rsquo;s the place where I spent my honeymoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;your&mdash;&rdquo; Johnny stared at him
through the darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Herman McCarthey&rsquo;s tone was
deep. &ldquo;I was married once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. She didn&rsquo;t die. Just went away.
They do that sometimes. She&rsquo;s living yet, and
happy, I hope. Successful too, and prosperous.
Buys dresses for a big store in New
York, swell dresses they say. Goes to Paris
every year and all that. Ten thousand a year,
maybe more.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">[163]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; his tone became very thoughtful,
&ldquo;she married the wrong man. That happens
too. I was only a cop, a plain ordinary
policeman. Perhaps she married my uniform.
Who knows?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I brought her out here. She wasn&rsquo;t happy.
&lsquo;Too still,&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So we took a flat in the city. But she
wanted what I couldn&rsquo;t give, kind of a society
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a time, he stared away to the west
where the first stars were appearing. Then he
spoke again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I bought this place on payments. When
we moved to the city I couldn&rsquo;t very well
keep up the payments, so I let it all go; or
thought I had.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But when she&rsquo;d left me and gone to New
York I sort of felt like I&rsquo;d like to come out and
see the old place&mdash;the place where I&rsquo;d spent
my honeymoon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what do you think? The man I&rsquo;d
bought the place from had saved it for me all
that time! All I had to do was begin paying
again, and it was mine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_164">[164]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s things like that that make me like
quiet country places. Men do such things out
here. Perhaps they do in the city, too. But
somehow I feel that a man is a bit nearer God
when he sees the dew on the grass, the red
in the sunset, and the gold in the moon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again he was silent for a time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All this,&rdquo; he went on then, &ldquo;hasn&rsquo;t made me
bitter. It&rsquo;s the duty and grand privilege of
most men to have a home and raise a family
of youngsters. It&rsquo;s the duty of us all, especially
of us officers of the law, to make it easy
and safe for those boys and girls to grow up
strong, clean, and pure. That&rsquo;s why an officer
who doesn&rsquo;t do his whole duty is so much of a
monster.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">[165]</div>
<h2 id="c18"><br />CHAPTER XVIII
<br />A SCREAM&mdash;A SHOT</h2>
<p>That particular Sunday was a happy one
for Rosy, the bright-eyed Italian girl.
Why not? It was her birthday. She was sixteen.
What is more wonderful than being sixteen?
Besides, her mother had given her a
new dress. It was real silk, the color of very
old Italian wine, this dress was, and trimmed
with such silk flowers as only the skillful fingers
of Mother Ramacciotti could form.</p>
<p>There were other reasons for happiness.
Rosy&rsquo;s life had known misery and sadness.
Now she had a home; very plain, it is true, but
comfortable. She had friends. Were not
Johnny and Drew her friends? Many more
there were at the radio studio. Rosy was a
favorite. Her obliging interest in all that pertained
to her duties, her ready smile, won
many.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">[166]</div>
<p>Then too, her mother had said to her that
very morning, &ldquo;Six months more, and we will
go to those so beautiful hills that are my home.
Your grandmother awaits us among her flowers
and her vines. The white-topped Alps will
look down upon us from afar. Ah! There is
a country! Italy! Oh, my beloved Italy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rosy had not seen Italy. Her mother had
painted glowing pictures of that land. Oh!
Such pictures! Who can say which one
longed most for that land, mother or daughter?</p>
<p>A gay time they had that day. Drew was
in for dinner. They had ravioli a la Tuscany,
and after that some very rare fruit cake that
had come only the week before from sunny
Italy.</p>
<p>So proud of her new dress was Rosy, that
she needs must wear it to her work. Her
friends, all of them, must see how very beautiful
it was. So, with a smile on her lips, and
a dimple in each cheek, she departed, waving
goodbye. Rosy, happy Rosy!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">[167]</div>
<p>At the studio she was greeted with many
smiles and hearty congratulations. In time,
however, all her friends had passed to their
work on the floor above, leaving Rosy there
alone.</p>
<p>It was always a little dreary down at the
foot of the stairs. Only an occasional buzz at
the switchboard disturbed the silence of the
place. Faint, indistinct, seeming to come from
another world, the mingled notes of many musical
instruments floated down from above.
Some tunes were merry; some sad.</p>
<p>On this particular night, for no reason at all,
they all reached her ears tinged with melancholy.
What was it? Is great happiness
always followed by a touch of sadness? Was
a shadow of the future stretching out to engulf
her?</p>
<p>In one studio was a massive pipe organ. At
9:30 the organist, ascending to the console,
left the studio door ajar. The pealing, throbbing
notes of this organ drifted down to Rosy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">[168]</div>
<p>For each of us there is some musical instrument
whose notes stir us with joy, another
that awakens a feeling of sadness. To Rosy
the pipe organ carried a feeling of infinite pain
and sorrow. On that tragic day, when her
murdered father had been carried to his last
long rest they had led her, at her mother&rsquo;s
side, to a great dark, damp and lofty room
that was a church. There for one long, torturing
half hour she had listened to the most
mournful tones she had ever known. The
tones had come from a pipe organ.</p>
<p>Now, as she sat listening, it seemed to her
that the dampness, the darkness, the gloom of
that vast church were once more upon her.</p>
<p>She shuddered. Then, though the night
was warm, she threw a wrap about her shoulders.
Her fingers trembled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That door,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;I will go up
and close it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had risen and was turning about when,
of a sudden, her blood froze in her veins. Directly
behind the place where she had been
sitting, were two men. One was half concealed
by a door. His head and shoulders were
within a closet. The other looked squarely
at her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">[169]</div>
<p>Two things Rosy&rsquo;s startled eyes told her at
a glance. The man who looked at her was
young. His face was like a mask. The other
man had a hole in his hand.</p>
<p>It was enough. Without willing to do so,
she screamed. It was such a long-drawn,
piercing scream as one utters but once or twice
in a lifetime.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>In the meantime, under quite different circumstances,
Johnny and Sergeant McCarthey
were discussing their latest problem, the derelict
from New York.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has he told you how it all came about?&rdquo;
Johnny asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. He won&rsquo;t tell that. What&rsquo;s the use?
He knows I am a detective. He knows I
know all that&rsquo;s worth knowing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Someone has told you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. They never need to. I&rsquo;ve seen it
before; too often. Too often!&rdquo; Sergeant McCarthey&rsquo;s
tones were sad. For some time he
said no more. When he did speak it was with
the voice of one who has resolved to tell much.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">[170]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re young, son,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
know a great deal about this business of hunting
down criminals. You heard Mills say
there were no stool pigeons used in that kidnapping
case we solved?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To me that remark was significant. He
hates stool pigeons. Everyone does. A stool
pigeon is a person who, for pay or for immunity
from arrest for some crime he has
committed, tells on some other person.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are men on every police force, good
men too, who believe that criminals cannot be
captured without the aid of stool pigeons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how one must come to hate them when
he is obliged to deal with them constantly.
Perhaps you think of stool pigeons as poor,
weak-eyed, slinking creatures who can earn a
living in no other way. If so, you are wrong.
Some are rich, some are poor, some men, some
women. All are alike in two particulars. All
want something; for the most part protection
for some form of petty vice or crime. And
they all crawl. How they do crawl!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">[171]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you don&rsquo;t quite understand. It&rsquo;s
using the little criminal to catch the big one.
Take an example. Some Greek runs a cheap
gambling house. With card games and roulette
wheels he entertains laborers and takes
their money. He breaks the law. But he
knows of a man who has robbed a bank. He
is afraid of having his place raided, having his
evil means of living taken away. He becomes
a stool pigeon by informing on the robber.
After that the detective uses him on many
cases.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how must the detective feel who has
dealings with such a man? You can&rsquo;t play
with snakes unless you lie down and crawl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little by little, the thing gets you. To associate
with stool pigeons you must do the
things they do. You begin to drink. You
do other things. You break the law. But the
law forgives you, for you are working for it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you see? No matter how high your
ideals were in the beginning, how lofty your
aims, you step down, down, down, when you
deal with stool pigeons.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_172">[172]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It was so with him.&rdquo; He nodded his head
toward the room in which the white-haired one
was sleeping. &ldquo;I happen to know. When I
worked with him there was no finer man on
any force. A college man, born to his task,
enthusiastic for it from his youth; no one
promised more. But his Chief believed in
stool pigeons. He had a complicated, well
guarded system of informers. Newton Mills
was forced into this system. A man of sensitive
nature and much native honor, he went
down fast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have never used a stool pigeon in my life.
I never will. Perhaps I am wrong. Crime
must be punished. It&rsquo;s a matter of method.
I have informers, but they are all honest citizens.
They tell what they know, and ask
nothing in return. They are my friends.
They are more than that. They are true
Americans. It is the duty of every honest
citizen to inform the officers of the law when
he learns of any flagrant violation of the law.
Perhaps if every citizen did his full duty, there
would be no need of stool pigeons. Who
knows? I&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">[173]</div>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the telephone,&rdquo; he broke off suddenly.
&ldquo;Go answer it, will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny sprang through the door and disappeared
into the dark interior of the house.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>The young man with a face like a mask
was not one of those who love the sound of
his own gun overmuch. But he was, by nature,
a killer. When Rosy screamed, indeed
even as she did so, he whirled about and, without
removing his hand from his hip, fired one
shot.</p>
<p>Rosy crumpled to the floor. Soon a scarlet
stream began disfiguring her bright new birthday
dress. Her eyes closed as in death. Her
cheeks were white with pain.</p>
<p>When a throng of musicians and operators,
electrified by Rosy&rsquo;s scream, at last came to
their senses and, led by Bill Heyworth, came
pouring down the stairs, they found Rosy
lying unconscious on the floor. Otherwise
the place was deserted.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_174">[174]</div>
<p>Some time later it was found that a wire
had been cut in the closet back of Rosy&rsquo;s
chair. This wire ran through the closet to the
studio above. It was the private wire from
the Central Police Station to the radio squad
call room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">[175]</div>
<h2 id="c19"><br />CHAPTER XIX
<br />A BULLET</h2>
<p>Johnny Thompson was not at the
telephone for more than the space of one
minute. When he returned to the porch
where Herman McCarthey sat placidly smoking,
he was choked with emotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s Rosy,&rdquo; he said in a scarcely audible
voice, &ldquo;Rosy! They have shot her!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; Herman sprang to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The crooks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the radio station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one knows. A wire was cut. The private
wire of the police. She was shot. No
one was seen by anyone but Rosy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For one distressing moment they stood
there silent. Then a voice came from the half
darkness of the house door.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">[176]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The bullet!&rdquo; that voice said. &ldquo;Have they
found the bullet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No one answered. They were too greatly
astonished. Standing there in the doorway,
before Johnny and Herman, looking like a
ghost, dressed in a white bathrobe as he was,
and with white hair flying, stood Newton
Mills, the derelict detective.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I say!&rdquo; his voice rose shrilly insistent.
&ldquo;Have they saved the bullet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; said Herman McCarthey a trifle
shakily, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s have a light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There! That&rsquo;s better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He peered into the face of Newton Mills.
The face was wan, ghastly. But the eyes!
a fresh fire burned there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t tell you, did they?&rdquo; Herman
said, speaking quietly to Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bullet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t say anything about a bullet.&rdquo;
Johnny was at a loss to know what it was all
about.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">[177]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You must call them,&rdquo; said the gray detective.
&ldquo;Tell them to preserve it carefully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will call them at once.&rdquo; Herman McCarthey&rsquo;s
tone was that used by a subordinate
officer to his chief. He went to the telephone
immediately.</p>
<p>He got Drew on the phone, talked with him
for a little time, then ended by saying, &ldquo;We
will drive in at once. Yes, at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not dead. The doctor says there is
hope.&rdquo; There was relief in his tone. &ldquo;She has
been conscious for a brief time. The man who
fired the shot was a youth with a mask-like
face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A mask!&rdquo; Johnny exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have heard of him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than that. Seen him. He and another
crook nearly waylaid me on the Drive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have the best of me. I never saw him.
But I fancy the fellow has a record. Question
is, what were the rascals about?</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the other man,&rdquo; he exclaimed quite
abruptly, &ldquo;was the man with a hole in his
hand! He was the one who beat you up.
Matters appear to have come to a head. We
will put all these together and arrive at something.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_178">[178]</div>
<p>&ldquo;And the bullet?&rdquo; It was Newton Mills
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was unable to learn anything. However,
I cautioned them to save the bullet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; muttered Mills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are driving to the city at once,&rdquo; said
Herman. &ldquo;Shall you go with us? May I
ask you to assist us in this case?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Newton Mills&rsquo; slight form stiffened perceptibly.
&ldquo;I will gladly do all I can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny understood. He loved Herman McCarthey
for his generosity, his foresight, his
extreme benevolence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may save this man Mills for a great service,&rdquo;
he told himself, &ldquo;and who knows better
than he how to bring these inhuman ones to
justice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In an incredibly short time Newton Mills
was clothed and ready to go. He took the seat
beside Herman McCarthey. Johnny sprang
into the back seat. The motor purred and
they were away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">[179]</div>
<p>As they sped toward the city Johnny sat
hunched up in one end of the seat, the greater
part of the time immersed in deep meditation.
From time to time Newton Mills leaned over
to speak to Herman McCarthey. Johnny
caught snatches of the conversation. Always
it had to do with bullets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bullets?&rdquo; Johnny said to himself. &ldquo;What
can one learn from a spent bullet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So they sped on through the night. As the
hand on the dial of the great illuminated clock
that overlooked the city pointed to 1:00 they
slid into Grand Avenue and came to a stop
before the shack.</p>
<p>As they passed the Ramacciotti cottage
on their way to the shack, Johnny noted that
the place was illumined by a single tiny lamp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rosy is dead!&rdquo; was his melancholy
thought. &ldquo;That is the light of the death
watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was not true. Rosy was in the hospital.
Her mother had gone to her bedside.
That she might not be obliged to re-enter her
cottage in darkness, she had left the light.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_180">[180]</div>
<p>Drew awaited them in the shack. The
tragic story was soon told. The birthday
party, the new dress, the return to work, the
silent house, the strange men, the hand with
a hole at its center, the face that was a mask;
the scream, the shot&mdash;no detail was omitted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; concluded Drew, &ldquo;the poor girl
hovers between life and death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the bullet?&rdquo; insisted Newton Mills
excitedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been removed. I have it. Here it
is.&rdquo; Drew dropped a pellet of lead into the
trembling hand of the old-time detective.</p>
<p>Johnny shuddered and turned away at sight
of it.</p>
<p>Holding it between thumb and finger, as a
jeweler might a pearl, Newton Mills examined
it with a critical eye. He turned it over and
over. He studied it from every possible angle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The forceps,&rdquo; he commented at last, &ldquo;have
done harm, but not too much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; he said, turning it over once again,
&ldquo;is a precious thing.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">[181]</div>
<p>Thrusting his hand in his pocket, he drew
forth a small leather pouch. From this he
poured a handful of coins. He put the bullet
in their place, wrote a few words on a slip of
paper and thrust it after the bullet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There must be no mistake,&rdquo; he murmured
as he drew the strings of the pouch tight and
put it back into his pocket.</p>
<p>As if to say, &ldquo;Money is of little consequence,&rdquo;
he scooped up the coins and dumped
them loose into another pocket.</p>
<p>Then Herman McCarthey, Drew, and the
strangely reclaimed derelict sat down to discuss
the various aspects of the case and map
out plans.</p>
<p>As for Johnny, he felt a need for solitude.
He left the shack, made his way to the street
level, and there wandered amid the shadows
that are a city street three hours before dawn.</p>
<p>For a long time he found himself incapable
of thinking in a rational manner. The whole
affair had come to him with the force of a
blow on the head. That such a thing could
have happened in a city in a civilized country
seemed incredible, monstrous.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">[182]</div>
<p>&ldquo;A girl!&rdquo; he fairly cried aloud, &ldquo;A mere
child in a birthday dress. She is at her post
of duty. She sees a hand, a face. She is
frightened. She screams. She is shot!&rdquo;</p>
<p>In an instant his mind was made up. He
would leave this city. He would leave all cities.
Cities were all bad. Man has made them. Man
is evil. God made the country. God is good.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But no!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I will not leave. I will
never, never go from this city until those monsters
are trapped like the beasts they are, and
punished!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Calmed by the firm resolve, he returned to
the shack. There he listened quietly to the
council of seasoned warriors as they mapped
out a campaign in which he was to have a definite
part.</p>
<p>When at last they all tumbled down upon
bunks or in great chairs for a few winks of
sleep, Johnny&rsquo;s eyes did not close at once. He
was still thinking of the man with the hole in
his hand. He had conceived a great and, beyond
doubt, a just hatred for that man.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">[183]</div>
<p>Upon what was this hatred based? Three
counts. First, he had beaten Johnny up when
his back was turned. He had not given him
the least shade of a fighting chance. No person
had so much as attempted this before. It
should not go unpunished.</p>
<p>Far mightier was the second count. This
man with his accomplice, the youth of the
masked face, had shot a defenseless girl, and
for no better reason than that she had
screamed. The shot might prove fatal. For
this, whether the girl died or not, these men
deserved the electric chair.</p>
<p>Third, and most important of all, based not
at all upon revenge, but upon a desire for the
good of all,&mdash;these were dangerous men. The
man-killing tiger in his jungle is not more
deadly. For this reason they must be speedily
brought to justice.</p>
<p>Has anyone in all the world ever known better
reasons for wishing to accomplish a given
task than Johnny had as he entered upon this
new field of endeavor?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">[184]</div>
<h2 id="c20"><br />CHAPTER XX
<br />A CARD FROM THE UNDERWORLD</h2>
<p>Long before Johnny and his companions
were awake, newsboys were shouting:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Extra! Extra! All about the radio studio
murder!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The newspapers, as is their custom, had exaggerated
a little. Rosy had not been murdered.
She was not dead. Yet, so slender was
the thread that held her once abundant life
to this earth of ours, it seemed that a breath of
air, a thought, might snap it, as the lightest
feather may snap the spider&rsquo;s web.</p>
<p>Her mother, sad faced, patient, resigned to
the many sorrows that fate, or what is worse
than fate, crime, had bestowed upon her, sat
at the girl&rsquo;s side.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">[185]</div>
<p>From time to time in her mind&rsquo;s eye she saw
the sunny hills of her native land, and seemed
to catch the gleam of perpetual snows on the
Italian Alps. This vision lasted but a moment.
Yesterday, as she had talked with Rosy, it had
seemed very near, very real indeed. But now
it was far away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rosy! My Rosy!&rdquo; she murmured, as a stubborn
tear splashed on her toil-worn hands.</p>
<p>Then, as if powerful hands suddenly seized
her by the shoulder and stood her upon her
feet, she rose from her chair. The tear was
gone. Gone, too, was the expression of pain
from her face. In its stead had come a look of
sudden, stubborn resolve. Her eyes glistened
like cold stars.</p>
<p>She left the hospital to board a street car.
At her cottage she dug deep into an ancient
Italian trunk. From its depths she extracted
a single square of cardboard. At the center of
the card was a name; in one corner an address,
in another, done in red ink with a pen, was a
number; that was all.</p>
<p>With this card in her hand, she marched to
Drew&rsquo;s shack and knocked.</p>
<p>No answer. She pushed the door open. No
one there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_186">[186]</div>
<p>She returned to her cottage. There, for a
full half hour, she sat in silent meditation. At
the end of that time she spoke aloud to the
empty room:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I will do it. If it is the last thing I do,
that I <i>will</i> do!</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have killed my husband, who was a
good man. Now they shoot my Rosy, who is
a good girl. Yes, I will do it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the air of one who has formed a purpose
from which she will not deviate, she
thrust the card within the folds of her dress.</p>
<p>The card was a secret token. The number
on that card was a password. It belonged to
the underworld. It admitted one to secret
places. How had the Ramacciottis come into
possession of this card? Who can say? When
people speak a common language in a foreign
land, strange things will happen. It was
enough that she had the card. She meant to
use it; had purposed to deliver it to Drew.
Drew was not there. Very well. She could
wait.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>Newspaper reports of the bold attack, of the
ruthless shooting, roused the usually apathetic
public. Two thousand dollars in rewards were
offered. A thousand humble men in all walks
of life became, overnight, zealous detectives.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">[187]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They have gone too far. This must end!
We must put a stop to it all!&rdquo; These were the
words on every honest person&rsquo;s lips.</p>
<p>But how? Who were the culprits? Where
were they to be found?</p>
<p>These questions could be answered best by
the city&rsquo;s detective force. And this force, in
the person of Drew Lane and Herman McCarthey,
together with those recently drafted
ones, Johnny Thompson and Newton Mills,
were doing their best to answer them.</p>
<p>The Chief of Detectives had granted Drew
Lane a leave of absence from his position as
pickpocket hunter in order that he might work
on this special case that had assumed such a
personal aspect for him. The pickpockets,
however, could not be neglected. It was necessary
for the team of Drew and Howe to
dissolve partnership for a time. Tom Howe
was given another partner while Drew Lane
joined Sergeant McCarthey.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_188">[188]</div>
<p>They were gathered in Sergeant McCarthey&rsquo;s
office at the police station. For his broad
sheets of paper the sergeant had substituted
oblongs of cardboard not unlike playing cards.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here are the clues, the possibilities,&rdquo; he
said, thumbing the cards with nervous fingers.
&ldquo;You will recall,&rdquo; he said to Drew, &ldquo;that when
those miscreants beat Johnny up in the radio
studio, three cases were reported which might
have a bearing on the case; that is, they happened
within a half hour of the time the boy
was slugged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the first place, let me say that this last
instance, when the girl Rosy was shot, appears
to eliminate one possibility. You remember
I had a sheet on which I proposed to record
the names of those who might have wrecked
the radio station on that first occasion because
their criminal ventures had been interrupted in
the past by radio squad calls.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">[189]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s off, I guess. This time the man with
a hole in his hand was engaged in cutting
wires. That&rsquo;s all he meant to do. The shooting
was an accident. That makes it certain
that he wanted the radio silent. Why? He was
afraid a squad call would go through. If he
cut that wire the police report could not come
in, and the squad call could not go out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now here.&rdquo; Once more he thumbed his
cards, as the others leaned forward eagerly.
&ldquo;Here are the records of last night&rsquo;s doings in
gangland, during the half hour after Rosy was
shot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Card No. 1. A daring theatre holdup on
State Street. It was to have been a rather
large affair, involving several thousand dollars.
Fortunately, it did not come out so well.
The greater part of the money had been spirited
away by the proprietor fifteen minutes
before the robbers arrived. They got only
about seven hundred dollars.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This robbery was pulled off by two heavy-set
men of dark complexion. They made a
fruitless attempt to locate the balance of the
money by going to an office in the basement.
Had a squad call gone through they might
have been caught. The cutting of those wires
saved them.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_190">[190]</div>
<p>&ldquo;The man with the hole in his hand and old
Mask Face are their men!&rdquo; Johnny exclaimed
impetuously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so fast.&rdquo; The sergeant held up a hand.
&ldquo;There was another case. A fur store was
robbed. More than ten thousand dollars in
furs is gone. They jimmied the back door and
hauled the stuff off in a truck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A watchman in the building adjoining saw
them working. Suspecting something crooked,
he called the police station. Had a squad call
gone through, these men, too, would have been
caught. They were not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you have it!&rdquo; He leaned back in his
chair. &ldquo;What do you say? Does our friend
Hole-in-His-Hand belong to the holdup gang,
or the fur store robbers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Drew thoughtfully, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve
got to go back to that other night when the
radio station was wrecked and Johnny was
beaten up. There were three cases that night,
weren&rsquo;t there?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">[191]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Three. A robbery by two boys in an empty
apartment, a stickup of a theatre and the dynamiting
of a safe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; the sergeant went on, &ldquo;that we
may drop the two boy robbers. They don&rsquo;t
seem to fit into the picture. But how about
the others?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They go in pairs,&rdquo; Drew spoke again.
&ldquo;Two theatre stickups go together. Men who
dynamite safes are likely to rob a fur store.
Those go together. Two and two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sounds like sense.&rdquo; The sergeant pinned
two cards together. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll play &rsquo;em that way.
But after all, the question is, where do the
radio station wreckers belong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the theatre stickups,&rdquo; said Drew.
&ldquo;The dynamiters and fur robbers,&rdquo; said
Johnny. &ldquo;They require most time for their
work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t both be right,&rdquo; the sergeant
grinned. &ldquo;All I have to say is, you&rsquo;ll have to
scurry round and find out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">[192]</div>
<p>&ldquo;This is our job. It&rsquo;s a mighty big one. And
the reward is large. Not alone the two thousand
dollars, but tremendous acclaim by the
people awaits your success.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All this time Newton Mills, the veteran, had
sat listening in silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the bullets?&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;How
about the bullets?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What bullets?&rdquo; The sergeant looked at
him in surprise. &ldquo;There was but one shot fired.
You have that bullet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On this last occasion, yes. But on other
occasions, no. When the girl&rsquo;s father was
killed a random shot was fired. When this
boy was beaten up,&rdquo; he nodded toward Johnny,
&ldquo;a shot was fired. These bullets doubtless
remain where they lodged. You are aware of
the fact that through the use of forensic ballistics
we have been able to convict many criminals.
The bullets in this case are likely to
prove of vast importance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And are you equipped to handle that side
of the case?&rdquo; asked the sergeant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Equipped?&rdquo; The veteran, Mills, opened his
hands. They were empty. &ldquo;We will need tools
and instruments.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">[193]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I have an expense account and access to
the station equipment. You may draw upon
these in my name. I will write you an order.
Anything else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One&mdash;only one more thing.&rdquo; Newton Mills
appeared to hesitate. &ldquo;I&mdash;I shall need an assistant.
I should like this boy.&rdquo; Again he
turned to Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How about it?&rdquo; The sergeant&rsquo;s eyes were
on Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I may be excused from my duties at the
station,&rdquo; Johnny said eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll arrange that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So now you are fixed.&rdquo; The sergeant turned
once more to Newton Mills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will begin work at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The veteran left the room. He was followed
by Johnny.</p>
<p>That was the manner in which Johnny became
the assistant of a veteran detective whom
he had saved from disgrace. The enterprise
promised adventures of a fresh and interesting
character. Johnny entered upon it with unlimited
enthusiasm.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">[194]</div>
<h2 id="c21"><br />CHAPTER XXI
<br />THE SECRET NUMBER</h2>
<p>When Drew Lane returned to the shack
an hour later, he was treated to a great
surprise.</p>
<p>Seated in his most comfortable chair was a
slender girl of some eighteen summers. Her
hair was dark; her eyes, of the eager sort, were
brown. Drew had never seen her.</p>
<p>As he entered the room she sprang up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He? Who? Why&mdash;&rdquo; Drew was astonished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have him locked up. They told me at
the police station that you would know where
he is. Where is he?&rdquo; Her voice rose to a
shrill note.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, I&mdash;&rdquo; Drew&rsquo;s mind was in a turmoil.
Who was this whirlwind? Whom did he have
locked up? At that moment, no one.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">[195]</div>
<p>He looked into those eager eyes. He studied
those high cheekbones, that sensitive
mouth, and read there the answer to at least
one of his questions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why! You&mdash;you are Newton Mills&rsquo; daughter.&rdquo;
He sat down quite suddenly. &ldquo;He&mdash;he
never told us&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That he had a daughter? He wouldn&rsquo;t.
He&rsquo;s that way.&rdquo; Her tone went cold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; Drew offered her
a chair. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She ignored the chair, but answered his
question. &ldquo;Joyce Mills. Where is my father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father? The last time I saw him he
was going out of a door. He&rsquo;s been assigned
to a case, a rather big case. Has to do with
what he calls ballistics. He&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He came to a sudden pause. The girl&rsquo;s face
was a study. Surprise, doubt, joy, sorrow,
laughter, tears; they were all there, registered
in quick succession.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A case! A case!&rdquo; she fairly shrieked. &ldquo;And
I thought he was in jail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She crumpled into a chair.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">[196]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Drew quietly, &ldquo;he might have
been. But he isn&rsquo;t. And he&rsquo;s not likely to be.
So you can set your heart at rest on that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Having regained her self-composure somewhat,
she leaned forward as if expecting to be
told more.</p>
<p>Drew humored her. He told, so far as he
knew it, the whole story of the downfall and
the redemption of Newton Mills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she breathed. &ldquo;And you saved him.
You and that boy!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny Thompson saved your father,&rdquo;
Drew smiled. &ldquo;The rest of us only helped a
little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She rose and advanced toward him.</p>
<p>There is no telling what might have happened.
But at this moment the subject of their
conversation, Newton Mills himself, opened
the door and entered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joyce!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;You here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father!&rdquo; There was an indescribable touch
of something in her tone that caused the tense
muscles of the man&rsquo;s face to relax. &ldquo;Father,
I had to come.&rdquo; She laid a hand on his arm.
&ldquo;And now you have a case, a very hard case.
He has told me. I must stay and help you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">[197]</div>
<p>&ldquo;No! No! You must not!&rdquo; The words came
like a startled cry from the lips of the veteran
detective.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, father, I used to help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes. That is all in the past. This case
is a dangerous one. It has to do with desperate
characters. It may mean death. I cannot
take you with me. You are too young.&rdquo; He
said these last words as if he were speaking of
going to the grave.</p>
<p>Dropping into a chair and cupping his chin
in his hands, he sat for some time thinking.
As he thought the blood vessels swelled and
throbbed on his broad temples.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have it!&rdquo; he exclaimed at last, springing
up. &ldquo;Your cousin Doris Mills lives in Naperville.
She is married. They are fine people. I
haven&rsquo;t a doubt of it, though I have never
seen them. You must go there. When this
affair is over, I, too, will come. We will have
an enjoyable time together.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_198">[198]</div>
<p>The girl, who had measured the emotions
that flowed through his being, did not say, &ldquo;I
will go,&rdquo; nor yet, &ldquo;I will not go.&rdquo; She said
nothing.</p>
<p>After opening a leather bag and fumbling
about among his belongings, her father handed
her an envelope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The address is on that,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>At once he appeared to forget her. Having
taken some small articles from his bag, he
thrust them deep in his pocket. One was a
very thin automatic pistol.</p>
<p>One glance about the room, a halting puzzled
stare at the pistol and arrow hanging
over Drew&rsquo;s bed, then he was gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was always like that.&rdquo; There was a
look of tenderness and a smile on the girl&rsquo;s
face.</p>
<p>She turned again to Drew. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t thank
you enough,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I must find Johnny
Thompson and thank him, too. It was terrible
when father lost interest in everything, and
took to forgetting in that horrible way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be all right now, I think,&rdquo; Drew replied.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">[199]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But I must help him!&rdquo; she exclaimed,
springing to her feet and walking the length
of the room. &ldquo;I must! I will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; said Drew in a quiet tone,
&ldquo;that this is no task for a girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Girl!&rdquo; She gave him a look. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m eighteen.
As long as I can remember, I&rsquo;ve been helping
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I was thirteen we went to live in
the worst corner of New York. Department
orders for him. Mother wouldn&rsquo;t go. Grandmother
is rich. She&rsquo;s in society. Mother&rsquo;s in
society. Society folks don&rsquo;t go to live on a
street where they&rsquo;re all Sicilians. I went. I
made him let me come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Learned the language, I did. Played around
with the kids. Found out things. Say! I found
out things he&rsquo;d never have learned any other
way!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe so.&rdquo; Drew&rsquo;s tone was still quiet.
&ldquo;But this is not New York.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him for a moment in silence.
When she spoke it was with some effort. &ldquo;Big
cities are all alike. I know!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">[200]</div>
<p>Dropping into a chair she remained silent
for a time. Then she said in a changed voice:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me about this case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Because he was beginning to like this girl,
Drew told her. &ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll get them,&rdquo; he concluded.
&ldquo;Justice is an arrow of fire. It burns
its way in time to every evil heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joyce took in every word. Then she asked
a question:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is Mrs. Ramacciotti?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the cottage just ahead of this shack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take me there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Drew led the way.</p>
<p>The instant the girl entered Mrs. Ramacciotti&rsquo;s
cottage she began talking. She spoke
in Italian, and Mrs. Ramacciotti, smiling for
the first time since the tragedy, answered her
in Italian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave you,&rdquo; said Drew. &ldquo;I have some
things to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please do.&rdquo; The girl sat down.</p>
<p>The two, the tall girl and the stolid Italian
mother, talked for a solid hour, always in
Italian.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">[201]</div>
<p>When they had ended, the mother said, &ldquo;If
you are going to this place, you will not be
safe. They will kill you. Unless I give you
this, they are sure to murder you.&rdquo; She drew
from the folds of her dress the square of cardboard
and pointed to the secret number in red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; the girl exclaimed. &ldquo;I understand.
How perfectly grand!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And, Miss,&rdquo; Mother Ramacciotti ran her
hand across her face, &ldquo;your hair, it is dark.
Your eyes also. There is this which comes in
bottles. Fine ladies who want to seem tanned,
they use it. You speak so good Italian. Put
this on hands and face. They will think you
are Italian. It is better so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks a lot,&rdquo; Joyce responded, &ldquo;I will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joyce Mills did not go to Naperville. She
went instead to a drug store and then to a
men&rsquo;s furnishing store. After that she went
into a barber shop and got a hair-cut.</p>
<p>As night began to fall upon the city, she
took a car on Madison Street and went west.
She dismounted at Ashland Boulevard and
walked slowly toward the south.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">[202]</div>
<h2 id="c22"><br />CHAPTER XXII
<br />STARTLING TRANSFORMATIONS</h2>
<p>Some twenty blocks from the shack, in a
south-westerly direction, well out of the
city&rsquo;s business section, and just off a broad
boulevard, there was a club. This was a very
unusual club. Entrance was by card. The
man at the door was old and very wise. He
had lived in Sicily in the days of the Mafia.</p>
<p>The place went by the name of the &ldquo;Seventy
Club.&rdquo; It is not certainly known what the
&ldquo;seventy&rdquo; stood for. There are those who said
it was the club of seventy thieves. Others insisted
that there were more than seventy members
and that not all were thieves. Be that as
it may, the police held no cards of admission,
and were granted entrance only when accompanied
by search warrants.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">[203]</div>
<p>On several occasions the police had entered.
Always they had found no cause for complaint.
At the front of the place was a lobby
and reading room; at the back, pool tables and
other tables for card playing. In the center
was a grill, where excellent food was served.</p>
<p>Men, for the most part of dark complexion,
shot pool and shuffled cards at the back. They
dined, often with ladies, in the grill and went
to smoke in the lobby.</p>
<p>The manager, a short, broad-shouldered
man, with deep set, gleaming eyes, presided at
a desk near the door and scrutinized all
comers.</p>
<p>To this man, on the very night of which we
are speaking, there came a youth. This youth
was dressed in a suit of modest gray. He wore
a dark tie, a gray shirt and black shoes. He
was dark complexioned with dark eyes and
close cropped hair. He was very slender of
build. His fingers were extremely long; his
feet small.</p>
<p>In his hand this boy bore a card. In one
corner of the card was a secret number done in
red ink. Truth is, everyone who entered here
possessed such a card, marked in just this
manner. Without the card, they did not enter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">[204]</div>
<p>The manager questioned the boy in his native
tongue, studying him the while. The boy
replied politely in the same tongue.</p>
<p>The manager scribbled a note, gave it to
him, then nodded toward the door at the back
of the lobby.</p>
<p>The boy went back. Half an hour later he
might have been found dressed in a dark
brown suit trimmed in gold braid, clearing
dishes from the tables in the grill. He had
been given a position as bus boy.</p>
<p>The building in which the club was located
rose only a single story from the ground. Did
it have a basement? To all appearances it did
not. The heating plant was situated back of
the billiard room. There were no outside entrances
to the place save the one at the front.
There were no stairways leading down.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">[205]</div>
<p>The grillroom possessed one slightly unusual
feature. Six telephone booths, standing in
a row, occupied one corner of the large grillroom.
One would have said that one, or at
most two booths, would have sufficed for such
a place. But no; here were six. And, if one
judged by the number of people who entered
the booths, one might have said there were not
too many, for people were constantly entering
and leaving them.</p>
<p>Two things were strange about these
booths. They were not constructed as other
booths are. True, they were just as broad
and just as tall; but they contained far less
glass. The windows were narrow and high.
In fact, once a person was inside and had
closed the door, nothing at all could be seen
of him.</p>
<p>This, one would say, was an improvement,
for who wishes to be seen grinning and gesturing
at a telephone, as one is forever doing?</p>
<p>The other feature was far more startling.
It was a thing you might not notice until you
had dined there many times. Did the new
bus boy take cognizance of it on that first
night of service?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">[206]</div>
<p>If one were to hazard a guess one would
answer, &ldquo;He probably did.&rdquo; That guess, however,
might easily be wrong; for, during the
entire evening the boy rendered faultless service.
He did not drop a dish, spill a glass of
water, nor do any of those things one is so
likely to do when startled.</p>
<p>The peculiarity of these six booths was that
they did not always disgorge the identical
persons who had entered them.</p>
<p>Now such a thing will seem strange under
any circumstances. If a short dark man
dressed in brown enters a telephone booth, and
three minutes later a short blonde man in gray
comes out, it might seem a curious circumstance.
But when a short, broad, dark complexioned
man in a blue suit enters and, after
five minutes, a tall blonde lady in a pearl gray
dress emerges, it is enough to cause the most
phlegmatic person to stare.</p>
<p>As for the guests, they paid not the slightest
attention to the succession of transformations
that were being made in these booths.
They went right on laughing and talking,
drinking coffee and munching salad, just as if
nothing unusual was happening in the world.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">[207]</div>
<h2 id="c23"><br />CHAPTER XXIII
<br />MANY BULLETS</h2>
<p>For Johnny Thompson the events of that
day were full of interest. They provided
him with a whole volume of speculations.</p>
<p>While Newton Mills was returning to the
shack for certain articles in his kit, Johnny
had been sent to a seed store. There he purchased
two hundred small cloth sacks. In
this manner he missed meeting Joyce Mills.
Since her father did not as much as mention
her name, he was not even aware of her existence.</p>
<p>Armed with a hammer and several small
chisels, they went first to an unoccupied store-room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">[208]</div>
<p>Having presented his papers to the janitor,
and procured the key, Newton Mills led the
way into this dingy cavern where dust lay
thick and cobwebs festooned the walls. This
room had known tragedy. It was here that
Rosy Ramacciotti had seen her father shot
down. Johnny fancied that if one were to
brush away the dust, he might still find blood
stains on the floor. He did not brush away the
dust. Instead he shuddered.</p>
<p>Then, so that his mind might be occupied
with brighter thoughts, he set himself at the
problem of picturing the place as it was before
the tragedy. Bright lights, gleaming
show cases, boxes of candy, their colorful
wrappings lending a note of cheer to the place,
and behind all this, smiling, happy to be of
service, Rosy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And after that,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;there&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His thoughts were interrupted by Newton
Mills, who was speaking aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cash register was about there. Rosy&rsquo;s
father had just waited on a customer. He
would not be far from this spot. The man
with the gun must have advanced from the
door, but not too far. He would aim so. The
bullet would take this direction. It lodged in
that wall.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">[209]</div>
<p>During all this time the veteran detective
went through a small dream which took him
about from place to place. He now marched
across the room at an acute angle from the
door, put his hand to the wall, felt about, then
uttered a low sigh of satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The medium sized chisel, please.&rdquo; He held
out a hand toward the boy.</p>
<p>Johnny supplied the required instrument.</p>
<p>After prodding about, first in the plaster,
then in a wooden lath at the back, the detective
gave vent to a second sigh as a leaden
pellet dropped into his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we have it,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;And not
badly preserved. It should present no difficult
problem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He placed the bullet, which had been fired
at Rosy&rsquo;s father several months before, in one
of the white cloth bags. To this bag he attached
a tag. He wrote a number on the tag,
recorded the same number in a small notebook,
and scrawled a few words beside the number;
then, having placed both notebook and bag
in his pocket, he turned to go.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">[210]</div>
<p>&ldquo;That is all here. We will go next to your
radio studio.&rdquo; He led the way out of the
gloomy place.</p>
<p>At the studio they searched the padded walls
until they located the bullet that had been fired
on the night when Johnny was beaten up.</p>
<p>This bullet was also secured, placed in a bag,
labeled and recorded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will return to the police station.&rdquo;
Once more Newton Mills led the way.</p>
<p>They spent the remainder of that day in a
vacant basement room at the police station.
To Johnny their occupation seemed passing
strange.</p>
<p>First they filled a barrel with cotton waste.
Next they went to a room in the station where
a great number of used arms were stored.
These had been taken from hoodlums, suspects,
and police characters. With his arms
full of pistols of all possible descriptions,
Johnny returned to the basement.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">[211]</div>
<p>For four hours after that, they practiced the
same bit of drama over and over. Newton
Mills loaded a pistol and fired it at the barrel
of waste. Johnny retrieved the bullet from
the waste. This bullet was bagged, numbered
and recorded. After that a different pistol
was fired, and the identical process repeated.</p>
<p>Darkness fell before they finished. As
Johnny left the basement he fancied that he
still heard the sharp crack of small fire-arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will return to the shack,&rdquo; said Newton
Mills. &ldquo;No. First we will go to the laboratories.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They took an elevator, mounted five floors,
then entered a room. The walls of the room
were lined with all manner of instruments.
With some of these Johnny was thoroughly
familiar. Others were of a sort of which he
knew nothing.</p>
<p>Newton Mills requested the loan of two microscopes,
some prisms, a curious type of
camera and various odds and ends of equipment.
These he wrapped in a bundle. He
tucked the bundle tightly under his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow,&rdquo; he said as they descended to
the main floor, &ldquo;I shall not require your services.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_212">[212]</div>
<p>Johnny was disappointed. His curiosity had
been roused by the strange occupation of that
day; it had been redoubled by the package
under Newton Mills&rsquo; arm. He had hoped that
the morrow would reveal the purpose of it
all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now,&rdquo; he told himself with a sigh, &ldquo;I
am left out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the three days that followed, Newton
Mills never left the shack. He rigged up
a curious affair made of microscopes and
prisms. With this he studied bullets. Bullets,
bullets, and more bullets were studied,
measured, compared, and studied again.</p>
<p>He ate little, drank much black coffee, took
numberless tiny photographs, sent these out
to have them enlarged, then pored over the
numerous enlargements, hours on end.</p>
<p>Since he had no part in this, and understood
it not at all, Johnny returned to the radio studio
and his squad calls. In this he found
slight comfort. Rosy was not there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">[213]</div>
<p>From time to time he made inquiries regarding
the girl. She was holding her own,
that was all. Time alone would tell whether
or not this bright world of sunshine and shadows,
of moonlight, springtime, birds&rsquo; songs,
and budding flowers was to exist longer for
her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">[214]</div>
<h2 id="c24"><br />CHAPTER XXIV
<br />NOT ON THE PROGRAM</h2>
<p>The new bus boy at the Seventy Club
was making progress. The boss liked
him. He had eyes in his head and a tongue in
his cheek. He also knew what they were for.
He did his work in an intelligent manner. He
talked little and asked no questions.</p>
<p>From time to time the boss called him to
his desk. There he plied him with questions
regarding their mutual friends in another
city. The boy knew an amazing amount about
this man&rsquo;s underworld friends there.</p>
<p>On the third night the boss pressed a telephone
slug into the boy&rsquo;s hand, and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go call your friend.&rdquo; He added a wink.</p>
<p>The boy entered one of the six booths,
closed the door firmly, slipped the slug into
its place, heard it click, then felt himself slowly
descending.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">[215]</div>
<p>There are those who might have cried out
at this extraordinary occurrence. Not this
boy. He merely mumbled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;So that&rsquo;s it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After that he was all eyes for what was to
come. He had not long to wait.</p>
<p>Having dropped some fifteen feet, in the
manner of a slow elevator, his curious conveyance
stopped. At the same time a door
directly before him slid open. He passed out.
The door closed.</p>
<p>He found himself in a second dining room.
At the back, too, there were tables for cards.
But how different it all was! Here was music,
dancing, drinking, gambling; just such a life
as the hard working members of gangland demand
while off duty.</p>
<p>From that night on, the new boy carried
dishes and brushed crumbs from the tables on
the floor below, this secret meeting place of
gangland. Did he prefer it so? Who could
have told? He went about his work in the
same mechanical, precise manner. He talked
little. He asked no questions. When the boss
descended to the floor below, he rubbed his
hands and seemed pleased.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">[216]</div>
<p>Despite the drinks, the music, the dancing in
this place, it possessed a somber air.</p>
<p>Pure unadulterated joy never comes to
those who attempt to extract pleasure from
that which has cost other people days of arduous
toil. This is a law of nature. Like the
laws of the Medes and Persians, this law altereth
not.</p>
<p>Men and women did not frequent this place
for pleasure alone. We have said it was a
club. Men meet in their clubs for purposes of
business. It was so here. That this business
might be transacted in the strictest privacy,
booths had been provided. It was the duty of
the new boy to bring away dishes from these
booths.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">[217]</div>
<p>On the second night of service here on the
floor below, the boy saw a tall, broad man with
the features of a southern European, but the
complexion of an Anglo-Saxon, with close-set
eyes of blue, and a mass of tumbled hair, enter
the second booth from the center. He had a
companion. The companion was younger
than he. At times this youth&rsquo;s face seemed
a mask; at others, when he smiled, it changed.
They ordered a sumptuous feast, these two:
chicken, Italian style; creamed new potatoes;
lobster salad; and a great black bottle. They
ate in silence.</p>
<p>As the bus boy removed the dishes, he noted
the large man&rsquo;s hand. It appeared to give him
a start. He barely avoided spilling a glass of
water on the table. Perhaps this was because
there was a hole in the center of the man&rsquo;s
hand.</p>
<p>Dinner disposed of, the younger man of the
pair left the booth, walked out upon the floor,
talked for a time to one of the entertainers, a
tall blonde, then held out his hand for a dance.</p>
<p>Shortly after that he returned to the booth,
poured a drink from the black bottle, then sat
in the semi-darkness talking in guarded tones
to his companion, him of the hole in his hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">[218]</div>
<p>At that instant a curious thing happened.
Against the wall, on the darkest side of the
booth, appeared a singular phenomenon. A
red arrow as long as a man&rsquo;s forearm was distinctly
to be seen. And even as the two stared
at it in astonishment, the arrow appeared to
flame, as if perhaps the walls were on fire.</p>
<p>The younger of the two men shot a startled
glance at his companion. Then, with fingers
that trembled ever so slightly, he drew a chain
that flooded the booth with light.</p>
<p>Instantly the arrow of fire vanished.</p>
<p>The light was extinguished. The arrow did
not return.</p>
<p>Once more the light was thrown on.</p>
<p>Chancing to glance down at the table, the
younger gangster uttered a low exclamation,
then put out a hand to grasp a note that had
appeared from nowhere.</p>
<p>Holding this up to the light, he read aloud
these words:</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Justice is an arrow of fire. It goes straight
to hearts that are evil. It burns as it strikes.
No one shall escape.</i>&rdquo;</p>
<p>The thing was done on white paper with a
typewriter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">[219]</div>
<p>For a full moment the two men stared at
one another in silence. Then they rose abruptly
to disappear into the secret booths where
one does not telephone.</p>
<p>It is a curious fact that no man ever grows
so hard, so stoical, so impervious to emotions
that he fails to retain a superstitious fear of
that which seems unnatural and uncanny.
The flaming arrow, the mysterious note,
stirred up within the hearts of these killers a
sense of dread such as no display of arms, no
great body of police, could ever inspire within
them.</p>
<p>This little affair most certainly was not on
the program as it had been prepared by the
heavy-set, stolid man who presided over the
door. Yet, strange to say, neither the man
with a hole in his hand, nor his companion,
spoke one word to the manager regarding the
affair as they left the clubroom above, for
the cooling air of night.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_220">[220]</div>
<p>The name by which the younger of these two
gangsters was known was Jimmie McGowan.
Jimmie was not the name his mother had given
him at birth. Nor was McGowan the one
he had inherited from his father. His face
was dark. His parents had come to America
from a foreign land.</p>
<p>This gave Jimmie no occasion to be
ashamed. That foreign nation has furnished
the world many of her bravest warriors, her
wisest statesmen, her sweetest singers. Still
Jimmie had chosen another name.</p>
<p>On the following night Jimmie and his
companion, who was named Mike Volpi, returned
to their booth on the lower floor of the
Seventy Club. The slender bus boy who hovered
about the place did not appear to notice
them.</p>
<p>They had ordered dinner and were seated
in the shadows talking when, of a sudden, the
flaming arrow once more appeared on the wall.</p>
<p>Like a flash Jimmie&rsquo;s hand threw on the
light. His sharp eyes looked for a note.
There was none. The need was not great.
The message of the flaming arrow was burned
on his brain:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Justice is an arrow of fire.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_221">[221]</div>
<p>The two men rose without a word. They
left the place without dining. They did not
return. Their actions spoke louder than words.
They appeared to say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is something alarming, sinister, terrifying.
Are we warned or threatened? Who
is to stand up against such an invisible force?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Was there, from time to time, about the
corners of the slim bus boy&rsquo;s lips on that
night the suggestion of a smile? Who can
say?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">[222]</div>
<h2 id="c25"><br />CHAPTER XXV
<br />A WOLF SEEKS CULTURE</h2>
<p>Jimmie McGowan was no ordinary
cheap crook. That is to say, he did not
deal in small change. He never picked a
pocket nor snatched a purse. He did not jimmy
a door to enter and carry away the silver
while a family was away.</p>
<p>He preferred to deal in matters pertaining
to thousands. He did not, however, disdain
a few hundreds if opportunity came his way.
By all this you may be led to conclude that he
belonged in a class with Robin Hood; that he
robbed only the rich, because they were rich,
and perhaps even slipped a little of his quickly
secured wealth into some poor man&rsquo;s hand.
But Jimmie was no Robin Hood, as you must
know from what follows.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_223">[223]</div>
<p>It chanced on a certain night that he saw a
man draw a sum of several hundred dollars
from his bank. The man walked away from
the bank. Jimmie, noting his direction, walked
around the opposite corner and, by doing a
double-quick down an alley, managed to meet
him at a dark corner two blocks farther on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hands up!&rdquo; commanded Jimmie.</p>
<p>The man hastened to comply. But at once
he began to plead with Jimmie. The money
was the result of two years of careful saving.
He meant to use it in paying a skillful surgeon
for straightening his child&rsquo;s spine. This child,
his only son, had been a cripple since birth.
But now he might be made to walk.</p>
<p>It chanced that the man was telling the
truth. But must a high class robber believe
all that he hears on the street? Was he to be
expected to accompany the man to his home
and see for himself that the truth was being
told?</p>
<p>Most certainly not. At least, so concluded
Jimmie. He struck the man on the head, took
his money and departed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">[224]</div>
<p>The man went to the hospital. His son remained
a cripple. And Jimmie, being one of
those persons known among his friends as a
&ldquo;hot sport,&rdquo; put on a party that very night
which was the envy of all his pals. Such a
feast, such drinking, such dancing! Well, that
was Jimmie.</p>
<p>Jimmie knew how to dress. Never doubt
that. His suits were tailor-made. His shirts
were custom-made to match his suits, and his
ties to match the shirts. At all times Jimmie
was immaculate. It pays in his line of business.
A natty burglar gets fine notices in the
papers.</p>
<p>Nor was Jimmie entirely devoid of culture.
Back in his family somewhere, there had been
a musical strain. At the symphony orchestra
opening concert or the opera first night, unless
too greatly annoyed by the troublesome police,
Jimmie was present. And invariably he
was accompanied by a person described in the
papers as a stunning blonde. The blonde was
dressed in an opera cloak of dark, dark purple,
trimmed in richest white fox. It was not
always the same blonde. It was always the
same cloak. Jimmie provided that. For how
is one to enjoy culture unless he has a lady on
his arm? Well, that was Jimmie.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">[225]</div>
<p>On the night following that disagreeable
affair of the flaming arrow, Jimmie was not at
the Club, nor was he with Mike Volpi. Instead
he was out in search of culture. With
a lady on his arm, he was strolling a certain
park where, every summer, opera is put on
in the open air. Drew Lane was also there.</p>
<p>Drew saw Jimmie. He had never seen him
before, nor even heard of him. For all this,
instinct, trained by experience, said to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is a crook. He has a gun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now there is one trinket which no plain
citizen may carry&mdash;a gun.</p>
<p>Drew stepped up to Jimmy and patted him
on the back, exclaiming:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you, son?&rdquo;</p>
<p>That instant Jimmie&rsquo;s face became a mask.
Well for him that Drew was not looking at his
face. Instead he was watching Jimmie&rsquo;s hands.
Also his own hands were busy. They were
extracting a gun from a hidden pocket in
Jimmie&rsquo;s coat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">[226]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t a thing on me.&rdquo; Jimmie&rsquo;s tone
was low. It was also the snarl of a wolf. &ldquo;You
can arrest me for that, but it will do you no
good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Drew knew he spoke the truth. A man may
be fined or imprisoned for carrying a gun, but
only when the officer who takes the gun has a
search warrant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad to have met you, old son.&rdquo; Drew
spoke in a tone of counterfeit cordiality. At
the same time he displayed a little corner of
his star.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will be glad to meet you under different
circumstances.&rdquo; Once more it was Jimmie the
wolf who spoke in scarcely audible tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt you will,&rdquo; said Drew. &ldquo;And
here&rsquo;s luck to the best man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Drew lost himself in the crowd. Jimmie&rsquo;s
gun was in Drew&rsquo;s pocket.</p>
<p>Had Drew been asked just how he knew
that Jimmie was a crook who carried a gun, he
could not have told.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">[227]</div>
<p>His reasons for taking the gun were clear
enough. A snake without fangs is harmless.
So, too, is a crook without a gun. The fewer
guns there are in a night crowd such as this,
the better. For all that, Jimmie seldom mixed
business with pleasure. Without doubt he
carried that gun for defense only. For the
moment he was defenseless; quite as defenseless
as his many victims. What a pity that the
victims did not know this! As it was, Jimmie
and his companion imbibed fresh culture without
further disturbance.</p>
<p>That night when Drew returned to the
shack, he found the slight form of Newton
Mills still bent over his microscope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There you are, Old Timer!&rdquo; Drew exclaimed
as he removed the clip from Jimmie&rsquo;s
gun and let it drop with a clatter on the table.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s another little plaything for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Newton Mills looked at the gun for a space
of ten seconds. Then, as his weary eyes became
focused upon it, he seized it eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the type!&rdquo; His words were tense.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, the type?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the type of gun from which that bullet
was fired.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">[228]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What bullet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The one that may have ended the life of
your good friend Rosy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will try it out, examine the bullet to-night.
Now.&rdquo; Drew reached for the gun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to-night.&rdquo; Newton Mills made that
old familiar gesture seeming to brush cobwebs
from his face. &ldquo;My eyes are gone for to-night.
To-morrow will do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Drew started to hang the gun on a nail beside
the one that had hung there so long.
Newton Mills took it from him and buried it
deep in the bottom of a chest. He then locked
the chest and hid the key.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can never be too careful,&rdquo; he said
quietly. &ldquo;Things happen when we least expect
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the way!&rdquo; He changed the subject.
&ldquo;Where did you get that gun?&rdquo; He pointed
to the one hanging close to Johnny&rsquo;s blood-stained
arrow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">[229]</div>
<p>Drew sat down and told the story of the
gun and the arrow, as it was enacted that dark
night on the deserted slip.</p>
<p>Newton Mills drank in his every word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s strange I never told you about that
before,&rdquo; said Drew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; agreed the veteran detective.</p>
<p>Reaching up, he took the gun from its nail
and brushed away the spider&rsquo;s web. After
that he unlocked the chest and placed this gun
beside the other. Without another word, he
undressed and went to bed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">[230]</div>
<h2 id="c26"><br />CHAPTER XXVI
<br />THESE ARE THE GUNS</h2>
<p>Johnny was awakened early next morning
by the sound of muffled shots.</p>
<p>Drew too was awake. He was sitting up
in bed, listening. The Old Timer&rsquo;s cot was
empty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wha&mdash;what is it?&rdquo; Johnny asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shots,&rdquo; Drew replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the basement of the Ramacciotti cottage,
I would say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This guess was correct. Having awakened
before dawn, Newton Mills had removed the
two guns from the bottom of his chest, had
searched in a box for cartridges, then had
crept quietly out of the room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">[231]</div>
<p>He had meant to go down to the beach and
fire shots into the sand. However, having
found Mrs. Ramacciotti in her kitchen, he had
stuffed a keg with rags and had retired to her
basement. There he fired three shots from the
young gangster&rsquo;s gun and three from the one
that had so long been hanging on the wall of
the shack.</p>
<p>He left the cellar, as soon as he had retrieved
and labelled the bullets, and returned
to the shack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out gunning rather early,&rdquo; Drew commented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey? Yes. Important, I&rsquo;d say.&rdquo; Newton
Mills seated himself at his bench, switched on
a light, and at once lost himself in a study of
the freshly fired bullets.</p>
<p>At a certain time, had one chanced to observe
him closely, he would have noted that
intense excitement gripped him. His fingers
trembled. Three times he dropped the same
bullet. His lips trembled as if with palsy.</p>
<p>A few moments later he became a creature
of marble calmness. Turning about in his
chair he stood up, stretched his arms, straightened
his tie, then announced quietly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are the guns.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">[232]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What guns?&rdquo; Drew looked up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; he said, patting Jimmie McGowan&rsquo;s
gun, the one Drew had taken the night before,
&ldquo;this thin automatic is the gun that fired the
shot that has perhaps taken the life of Rosy
Ramacciotti.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had he exploded a bomb in the center of
the room, he could not have caused greater
excitement. Drew leaped to his feet, overturning
his chair with a crash. Johnny allowed
a glass of water to slip from his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That gun!&rdquo; Drew exclaimed as soon as he
had regained possession of his senses. &ldquo;Why!
I had that man in my hands, unarmed, defenseless,
last night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t help that,&rdquo; Newton Mills smiled a
dry smile. &ldquo;Bullets don&rsquo;t lie, not to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is more&mdash;&rdquo; He laid a hand on the
other gun, the one that had been taken from
a murderous hand on the deserted slip on the
night Johnny shot an arrow, &ldquo;this is the gun
that killed Rosy&rsquo;s father. It is also the gun
that fired the shot in the studio on the night
that Johnny was beaten up.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">[233]</div>
<p>The two boys stood there for some time,
silent, dumfounded by such startling revelations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since you know this much,&rdquo; the Old Timer
went on at last, &ldquo;you may as well know the
rest. Let me explain to you how it is that
I can know these things with such certainty.
I will explain it to you just as I would to a
jury. May take a little time, but in view of
the large place this new science of forensic
ballistics is sure to play in future detection of
crime, I am certain it will be time well spent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a tap at the door. Mrs. Ramacciotti
appeared with the morning coffee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; exclaimed the Old Timer. &ldquo;Coffee
and bullets. What could be sweeter!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">[234]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Forensic ballistics,&rdquo; he said musingly as he
sipped hot coffee, &ldquo;sounds rather impossible,
doesn&rsquo;t it? It means only this. Forensic, having
to do with the law; ballistics, the science
of projectiles. Forensic does not interest us.
Ballistics, for us, means the science of bullets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, reaching for Jimmie&rsquo;s automatic
and glancing down its barrel, &ldquo;you
know that the barrels of revolvers are rifled;
that is, there is a series of spiral grooves running
through each barrel. That is done to
make the bullet go straight. A smooth surface
causes the bullet to tumble end over end the
instant it leaves the gun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taking three small white sacks from his
bench, he emptied their contents on the table
before him: three bullets.</p>
<p>Displaying two of these on the palm of
his hand, he asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are they alike?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Drew after a moment&rsquo;s scrutiny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In what way do they differ?&rdquo; The detective&rsquo;s
eyes lighted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Let me have them.&rdquo;
Johnny studied them closely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The grooves in one are wider than in the
other,&rdquo; he said at last.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">[235]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Correct. In other words, there is one more
spiral groove in the barrel of one gun than the
other. So we know at once that if a bullet
killed a man it could have been fired from
only one of these guns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In fact the guns are of different makes.
No two manufacturers rifle their barrels in the
same manner. Some cut more grooves. Some
cut deeper grooves, and so on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have got this far,&rdquo; said the veteran
detective, taking a long drink of coffee, &ldquo;but
that isn&rsquo;t very far. There are thousands upon
thousands of automatics in this country, manufactured
by the same company. They are of
the same rifling, same caliber and all. Suppose
a bullet has been fired from a revolver.
It has killed a man. You think you have the
gun. You wish to say to judge and jury, &lsquo;I
have the gun that killed the man. This is the
gun. I will prove it to you by a study of bullets
fired from it.&rsquo; In view of the fact that
there are thousands of such guns in existence,
of the same caliber and manufactured by the
identical machinery, are you able to prove
that one particular gun fired the fatal shot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t seem possible,&rdquo; said Johnny.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">[236]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is possible, nevertheless.&rdquo; Newton Mills&rsquo;
eyes shone. &ldquo;With the aid of a comparison
microscope and micro-photography, it can be
done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the first place, the spiral grooves in a
gun are made by passing a narrow cutting
die many times through the barrel. No metal
has ever been found that will not wear. The
cutting die wears. Its edge becomes rough.
You cannot see the roughness with the naked
eye. A microscope reveals it. This rough
cutting edge imparts just such a roughness to
the spiral groove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since the cutting die is constantly wearing,
the roughness of the spiral groove of one
gun, when studied under the glass, will not be
exactly the same as that of any other barrel,
though cut by the same machine on the same
day.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, when a soft bullet is shot from a gun,
the rough edge of the groove leaves scratches
upon its surface. You cannot see these
scratches with your naked eye. The microscope
again reveals them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">[237]</div>
<p>&ldquo;When you put two bullets fired from two
guns of the same identical type under a comparison
microscope, you can see them both at
once and can place their scratches side by side
and end to end, and you know at once that
they were not fired from the same gun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if the scratches match perfectly, then
you know that the two bullets were fired from
the same gun, and no other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time both Johnny and Drew were
listening with all their ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This study,&rdquo; said Mills, &ldquo;is sure to be of
great service to the forces that make for justice.
Every crook has his weakness. A weakness
common to many is love for a particular
gun. A man has carried a gun and used it
many times. It has saved his life by taking
the life of another. The gun becomes his pal,
his defender. He does not willingly part with
it. And in this he reveals a great weakness.
That gun has left its trademark, its bullets,
behind. By these, man and gun may be
traced. If the gun falls into the hands of the
law, woe to the crook!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">[238]</div>
<p>&ldquo;As you know,&rdquo; he turned to Johnny, &ldquo;we
secured the bullet that wounded Rosy; also
the one that was fired that other time in the
studio; and the one imbedded in the wall at
Ramacciotti&rsquo;s old place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After examining these, we fired test bullets
from all guns taken by the police from
suspects during the past six months.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An exhaustive study of these showed that
the guns from which our three bullets were
fired had not been taken by the police. That
was a discouraging discovery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But now, as so often happens, just as we
seemed at a standstill, Drew takes a gun from
a suspect; he hauls another down from the
wall, and behold: here we have the very guns
we seek!</p>
<p>&ldquo;The test bullets fired from the gun of
Drew&rsquo;s suspect are exactly the same as the
one fired into Rosy&rsquo;s body. The ones fired
from the gun you took in such a strange manner
beside that deserted slip are exactly the
same as those fired by the man with the hole
in his hand. I will be able to prove this to any
jury by the use of enlarged photographs of
the bullets. I now have evidence that will convict
these two men. Bring me the men!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">[239]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Ah yes!&rdquo; Drew sighed. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it! Catch
the men!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we will do it!&rdquo; he exclaimed, springing
to his feet. &ldquo;Such men are a menace to any
community. No decent, law abiding citizen
is safe as long as they are at large. We will
get them. We will! We <i>must</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">[240]</div>
<h2 id="c27"><br />CHAPTER XXVII
<br />AN ARROW SPEEDS TO ITS MARK</h2>
<p>While the old time detective was making
these brilliant discoveries, Herman
McCarthey and Drew had made little
progress in their endeavor to find the men in
the case.</p>
<p>They had taken to riding a squad car at
night. A special car of great speed was assigned
to them. This car was equipped with a
loud gong. They worked only on radio squad
calls. The moment a call was announced, they
threw on the gas. If the case reported was
within a certain distance of the place where
their car was parked, they set their gong
clanging and dashed away.</p>
<p>In this manner, during a two nights&rsquo; vigil,
they had run down more than twenty squad
calls and had learned not one thing to their
advantage.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_241">[241]</div>
<p>They did not despair. &ldquo;The fish are here,&rdquo;
was Herman&rsquo;s sage remark. &ldquo;We may be
obliged to let down the net many times. At
last we will get them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the night following Newton Mills&rsquo; great
discovery, both the Old Timer and Johnny
decided to accompany the others on their
squad calls. Since Johnny was once more on
the late squad calls at the radio station, he
took with him his bow and arrows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll just drop you off there later in the
evening,&rdquo; was Herman&rsquo;s word to him.</p>
<p>It was well along toward midnight. They
had chased down four radio calls to no purpose.
It was beginning to look like another
wasted night. They were parked north of
the river on Main Street, when of a sudden
there struck their waiting ears a call that
promised much.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Roosevelt on Main!&rdquo; Herman exclaimed
in a breath. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the place they
picked the night Rosy was shot. Same gang.
Came back for the rest of the roll. Step on
the gas!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_242">[242]</div>
<p>The motor purred. The gong sounded.
They were away. By some unusual chance,
theirs was the first car to arrive.</p>
<p>They had not come to a standstill before
Herman, Drew, Mills and two men in uniform
were out of the car and bounding through the
theatre door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Down there!&rdquo; cried an excited youth in a
green cap. &ldquo;They went to the basement!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Down the stair they plunged.</p>
<p>In the meantime Johnny, gripping his bow
and arrow, and urged by who knows what instinct,
raced around the building to enter an
alley which ran at the back of the theatre&rsquo;s
stage.</p>
<p>Halfway down the stairs, Herman McCarthey
suddenly found himself facing two
stocky men. The foremost of these whipped
out a gun and fired. The bullet grazed Herman&rsquo;s
cheek and lodged in a policeman&rsquo;s
thigh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">[243]</div>
<p>A second shot followed instantly. Newton
Mills had gone into action. His bullet entered
the robber&rsquo;s heart. He fell back dead. The
other man turned to flee down the stairs. He
was struck down by a blow from Herman&rsquo;s
gun.</p>
<p>In the meantime, what of Johnny? Astonishing
things were happening to him. Hardly
had he entered the alley than someone sprang
around a corner of masonry and, without
noting him, began to approach.</p>
<p>The light of a street lamp fell on his back.
Johnny recognized him instantly. He had a
face that was like a mask. It was Jimmie McGowan.</p>
<p>Scarcely had Johnny stepped back to nock
an arrow, than the other saw him.</p>
<p>Among people of his own kind this youth,
Jimmie McGowan, was known as the quickest
trigger in all gangland. Nor was an
automatic lacking.</p>
<p>What saved Johnny? One curious circumstance.
As the gangster came to a halt, a
weird red light, from no one will ever know
where, fell upon Johnny and his bow. His
arrow was turned to a thing of flaming red.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">[244]</div>
<p>It was this weird light that sent cold terror
to the gangster&rsquo;s heart. The hand that did
not falter at the dealing of death was paralyzed
by fear of that which could not be understood,
the arrow of fire.</p>
<p>Before the gangster&rsquo;s hand could regain its
cunning, a missile came crashing into his
shoulder. It was Johnny&rsquo;s arrow. The gun
went clattering to the pavement. Next instant,
with the force of a tiger, Johnny leaped
upon mask-faced Jimmie McGowan and bore
him to the ground.</p>
<p>In the meantime Herman had made fast
work of the second robber. Having knocked
him down, he had him in handcuffs at once.
As he turned the fellow over, more than five
thousand dollars in currency dropped from beneath
his coat.</p>
<p>Drew had noted the direction Johnny had
taken. As soon as possible he followed in his
wake. He found Johnny sitting on the chest
of Jimmie McGowan. A feathered arrow protruded
from Jimmie&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got him!&rdquo; exulted Johnny. &ldquo;I got the
one we want!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_245">[245]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Silent Murder,&rdquo; murmured Drew. &ldquo;So you
have. But not so fast. Not another word at
this time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jimmie McGowan went to the hospital in
the jail to have Johnny&rsquo;s arrow removed.
Drew called the radio station and had Johnny
released from duty that night. Then they all
adjourned to the shack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We win!&rdquo; said Johnny exultantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so fast,&rdquo; said Herman McCarthey.
&ldquo;What was this bird doing when you shot him
with that arrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Coming down the alley. Preparing to
shoot me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you prove that he meant to shoot
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. But anybody knows&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. But not in court. Crooked lawyers,
and all that. This poor boy, meaning Jimmie
McGowan, was obliged to go out at night. He
carried a gun for protection. He met a
stranger. The stranger attempted to massacre
him with a murderous six foot bow.
Can&rsquo;t you see how they&rsquo;ll shape it up?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">[246]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but Rosy will identify him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps, if she lives. There are still grave
doubts regarding her recovery. But if she
does live, this boy has two faces, a smile and
a mask. He will show her the smile. She must
pick him from among other men. She was
frightened that night. Will she recall the
face? Well, perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there are the bullets. They are absolute
proof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are our best bet. We must guard
them well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A little later Newton Mills spoke to Johnny
in a low tone. At the same time he pressed
a package into his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You keep these until to-morrow,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a marked man. They won&rsquo;t suspect you
of having them. It&rsquo;s the bullets, the little pills
that will send that man of the masked face
down for life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perspiration started out on Johnny&rsquo;s brow
as he listened to these words. Nevertheless,
he stowed the small package deep in his innermost
pocket.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_247">[247]</div>
<p>&ldquo;They won&rsquo;t get them,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;None
of them will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As an afterthought, he drew the package
from his pocket, seated himself at a table, then
wrote his name and address on the outside of
the package. He then replaced it in his pocket.</p>
<p>This was a habit of Johnny&rsquo;s, of long standing.
Not for ten years had he carried a package
a distance of so much as one block without
first writing his name and address upon it.
Absent-minded people should keep their records
well. Johnny was, at times, absent-minded.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_248">[248]</div>
<h2 id="c28"><br />CHAPTER XXVIII
<br />TAKEN FOR A RIDE</h2>
<p>As often happens when men have a good
piece of work well off their hands, Drew
Lane and Newton Mills went to bed almost
at once, and were soon fast asleep.</p>
<p>Not so Johnny. He sat in a chair thinking.
The room was dark. That did not matter.
The men he had most feared were in prison
and in the hospital. One was dead. He had
not seen the dead man, nor his accomplice who
surrendered. As one will, he had assumed
that one of these was the man with a hole in
his hand. What could be more natural?
Those two, the youth of the mask-like face,
and he of the hole in his hand, had been together
on every other occasion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">[249]</div>
<p>As Johnny thought the thing through now,
the whole affair seemed clear. On the night
he had been attacked in the studio, this gang
had planned to rob a theatre. Two had come
up to silence the radio. Another pair had
pulled off the robbery.</p>
<p>On the second occasion they had not dared
to enter the radio studio, so had planned to
cut the private wire of the police. In doing
this they had frightened Rosy, and shot her,
either without purpose or to cover their escape.</p>
<p>On this, the third night, they had feared to
approach the radio station. Without doubt
they knew that now the station was strongly
guarded. They had disregarded the peril of
a squad call and had staged the robbery with
all hands on board.</p>
<p>In drawing these conclusions, Johnny may
have been partly right. In one matter he was
completely wrong. The man with the hole in
his hand had not been captured.</p>
<p>As Johnny was thinking of retiring he
touched a pocket. The pocket gave forth a
crackling sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A letter,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;Meant to mail it.
Forgot. May as well take it to the box now.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">[250]</div>
<p>As we have said, Johnny believed the entire
gang that had been troubling them were in
jail. He had no fear of the dark and empty
street. Indeed, as he walked the two blocks
that lay between the shack and the mail box,
he was thinking of that dark fishing hole on
the far shores of Lake Huron where the black
bass lurk.</p>
<p>He did not note the two men who lay in
hiding beneath the shadows of the Ramacciotti
cottage. Nor was he conscious of their
presence as they pussyfooted along after him.
Only when he was within ten paces of the mail
box did he turn his head half about, to see
them out of the corner of an eye.</p>
<p>It was with the greatest difficulty that he
suppressed a start.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bullets!&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;They know.
They are after the bullets.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What should he do? Like a flash a plan
of action came to his mind. Quickening his
pace a little, he allowed his left hand to drop
to his side, revealing the letter. At the same
time his right sought the inner pocket of his
coat.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">[251]</div>
<p>Arrived at the mail box, he put up both
hands, as one will; one to lift the metal flap,
the other to drop the letter. All this was true
to form, except that he dropped two parcels
instead of one.</p>
<p>As he turned about he was seized from behind.
A car glided to the curb. Three men
sprang out. He was overpowered, gagged and
thrown into the car.</p>
<p>Just as the motor purred a shadowy figure
sprang from the darkness, to leap upon the
spare tires which this car carried, and cling
there as the car sped away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Johnny thought grimly, &ldquo;they have
me; but they won&rsquo;t get the bullets. The trial
will go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next instant he received a shock. As
the light from a passing auto flashed upon
them, the man at the wheel of the car shifted
his position and Johnny saw his hand. He
was the man with a hole in his hand.</p>
<p>As the car sped swiftly westward, Johnny
realized that he was, in the language of gang-land,
being &ldquo;taken for a ride.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_252">[252]</div>
<p>His heart stood still. He felt a sudden chill
pass over him and the terror of it all came
to him. To-day, to-morrow, perhaps the next
day his bullet-ridden or fire-charred body
would be found beside some deserted road.
That was how they did it. They were possessed
of no heart, no compassion, no conscience.
&ldquo;Dead men tell no tales.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No greater falsehood was ever uttered than
this. Dead men have told many tales. More
than once a dead man&rsquo;s tales have brought
men to the gallows. But gangsters have not
learned this. They are a stupid lot.</p>
<p>One fact consoled Johnny. These gangsters
wanted something. They wanted the telltale
bullets that were capable of sending their fellow
gangster, him of the masked face, to the
electric chair or to prison for life. These they
would have at all cost. They undoubtedly expected
to find them on Johnny&rsquo;s person.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will question me,&rdquo; Johnny told himself.
&ldquo;I can stall; hold them off. They may
torture me!&rdquo; He shuddered and turned his
thoughts to other channels.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">[253]</div>
<p>He thought of that slim, dark-eyed girl,
Joyce Mills. Drew had told him all about her.
He was sure he would have enjoyed knowing
her. Frank, friendly, fearless, she would have
made a great pal. He regretted not having
seen her. Had she gone to her cousin&rsquo;s in Naperville?
Somehow he doubted that. She had
said she could help her father; that she <i>would</i>.
She had seemed very determined about this.
Was she trying to help? How? He had seen
no sign of it.</p>
<p>At that moment they approached the end of
a street. A blank brick wall loomed darkly
before them. Of a sudden, above the blur of
white caused by the car&rsquo;s lights, there appeared
a spot of vivid red which formed itself
into an arrow of fire, then as quickly lost form
and vanished.</p>
<p>At the same instant the car swerved sharply
to the right and missed an iron post by a narrow
margin.</p>
<p>The man sitting beside the driver seized
the wheel with a curse.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">[254]</div>
<p>The driver muttered something about the
&ldquo;arrow of fire,&rdquo; then settled down once more
to steady driving.</p>
<p>The thing puzzled Johnny. At the same
time it cheered him. He had not forgotten
the words of Drew Lane: &ldquo;Justice is an arrow
of fire.&rdquo; It seemed to him that he felt the
presence of someone hovering near him, someone
who cared and would help if such a thing
were possible.</p>
<p>The shadowy creature that had sprung out
to attach itself to the spare tires when the car
started, still clung there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_255">[255]</div>
<h2 id="c29"><br />CHAPTER XXIX
<br />THE NIGHT RIDE</h2>
<p>The car sped on and on into the night.
Past low narrow cottages interspersed
with apartment buildings, past long rows of
modern apartments, across countless railway
tracks, in and out among great looming factory
buildings, they glided.</p>
<p>Into the open country where the air was
heavy with the scent of weed dust and fresh
cut grain they went, and the end was not yet.</p>
<p>A stretch of broad paved road ended in
gravel and dirt. The car bumped and swung
from side to side.</p>
<p>Farmhouses, drowsy with night, flashed by
them.</p>
<p>At last, with a lurch, they swung off the
road and entered a narrow lane and arrived
in the back yard of a house that appeared
abandoned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_256">[256]</div>
<p>The grass, damp with dew, was up to their
knees as they alighted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more likely place could be found
for dark deeds!&rdquo; was Johnny&rsquo;s mental comment.
Once more he shuddered.</p>
<p>Still he did not wholly despair.</p>
<p>Pushing him before them, the gangsters approached
the house.</p>
<p>At the same time a dark shadow, that might
have been a dog, a wolf, or a skulking human
being, glided from the back of the car toward
a great barn that loomed away to the right.</p>
<p>Arrived at the door of the house, the man
with the hole in his hand gripped the doorknob
and shook it. The door did not open. Producing
a small flashlight, he turned it on the
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Padlocked,&rdquo; he grumbled. &ldquo;Tony&rsquo;s been
here. Got no key.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go to the barn,&rdquo; suggested a gruff
voice.</p>
<p>Without another word they turned and
started for the barn.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_257">[257]</div>
<p>Had they flashed their light against the one
small window on that side of the barn, they
might have seen there a frightened, staring,
but determined face.</p>
<p>When they entered the large room that had
doubtless at one time been a granary, the place
was deserted.</p>
<p>Had they looked carefully they might have
noted that the dust on the stairway leading to
the loft had recently been disturbed by fleeing
feet. They did not look. Their minds were
concentrated upon the telltale bullets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, young man.&rdquo; It was Volpi, he of
the hole in his hand, who spoke. &ldquo;Where are
them slugs?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Slugs?&rdquo; said Johnny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bullets then. Them bullets?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no bullets. I use no gun. I shoot
only with bow and arrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes! With those you are skillful!&rdquo;
Volpi&rsquo;s words carried infinite hate. He knew
what had happened to Jimmie McGowan.
Jimmie had been useful to him in many ways.
And now, who knows? Ah yes, he must have
those bullets at any cost.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_258">[258]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Look here, you!&rdquo; He advanced upon
Johnny in a threatening manner. &ldquo;You know
what slugs I mean. Them slugs that this New
York bull&rsquo;s been makin&rsquo; evidence with.
You&rsquo;re goin&rsquo; to give &rsquo;em up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not wait for Johnny to give them
up. He stepped up and thrust his hand into
the boy&rsquo;s inner coat pocket.</p>
<p>A look of blank astonishment overspread his
face. When he had gone hurriedly through
all the boy&rsquo;s pockets, he stood back to stare
into Johnny&rsquo;s face. His fingers worked convulsively.
His small eyes became buttons of
staring blue. It seemed that he would spring
at the boy and tear him to pieces.</p>
<p>At that instant a curious thing happened.
The room, lighted as it was only by a small
flashlight, was more than half in darkness.
Into that darkness there stole a strange red
light. On the floor, at the gangster&rsquo;s feet,
there appeared the flaming arrow of fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O-oof!&rdquo; The man sprang back as if from
a ghost. &ldquo;The arrow!&rdquo; he mumbled. &ldquo;The
arrow of fire!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_259">[259]</div>
<p>As on those other occasions, even as he
spoke, the apparition vanished.</p>
<p>Whatever may have been the gangster&rsquo;s intentions
in the beginning, they had been
changed by the arrow of fire. Leading his men
into a corner, he began to talk to them in
whispers. Was he recounting to them in detail
the history of that mysterious arrow? No
one but they will ever know.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_260">[260]</div>
<h2 id="c30"><br />CHAPTER XXX
<br />MANY PERILS</h2>
<p>The person who leaped upon the back of
the car as it went speeding out of Grand
Avenue, who left it only as it arrived at the
abandoned farmyard, and who now found
himself in the mammoth hayloft of that barn,
was none other than the new bus boy of the
Seventy Club.</p>
<p>You may have guessed that this person was
not a boy, but a girl, and that her name was
Joyce Mills. This is true.</p>
<p>The thought of going to Naperville, of lolling
about in white duck skirts on summer
porches or playing tennis with well-to-do and
self satisfied suburbanites had been abhorrent
to her. The love of adventure was in her
blood.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_261">[261]</div>
<p>More than that; she had come to this city
with the expectation of finding her father in
jail. Instead, thanks to a boy, a young detective,
and a sergeant of the force, she had found
him free and employed as he should be at the
task for which God had created him. She
wanted above everything else to prove herself
of service to those who had brought so much
joy into her life. She wished to assist in the
capture of Jimmie McGowan and his gang.</p>
<p>This was not the first time she had masqueraded
as a boy. More than once, while
living in the Sicilian quarters of New York,
she had dyed her face brown, donned trousers
and haunted dark places of crime, as a newsboy
or a city waif.</p>
<p>Having secured the secret card, she had
donned her disguise and had succeeded in getting
herself employed at the Seventy Club.</p>
<p>She had been able to shadow the gang. She
had witnessed the capture of the crook, Jimmie
McGowan, had learned of the intended
reprisal, had ridden to the shack on the back
of the gangster&rsquo;s car, and had seen them spying
there.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_262">[262]</div>
<p>There had been no opportunity for warning
Johnny. She had ridden on the car to this
deserted spot in the hope that here she might
be of some service.</p>
<p>Her best course at present appeared to be
that of leaving the barn and going for help.</p>
<p>But how was this to be effected? There
appeared to be but two entrances to the hayloft:
the trapdoor which led to the room now
occupied by the gangsters, and a large one
very high up, through which in days of farming
the hay had been drawn. Both of these
were too dangerous. The way seemed blocked.</p>
<p>As her eyes became accustomed to the light,
however, she saw a ladder leading to the very
peak of the barn. It ran up one end, and was
only a dozen paces from the spot where she
stood.</p>
<p>The floor was strewn with chaff. Her light
footsteps, as she moved toward the ladder,
made no sound.</p>
<p>With one hand on the first round of the ladder,
she paused to remove her shoes and tie
them about her neck.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_263">[263]</div>
<p>Nimble as a squirrel, she darted up the ladder
to the very peak of the barn. A small
opening there gave her a view of the overgrown
pasture that lay dizzy depths below.</p>
<p>The moon was out. She could distinguish
every detail of the scene beneath her. Beyond
the narrow pasture was a field of wheat in
the shocks. These shocks cast dark shadows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like so many tombstones in a cemetery,&rdquo;
she told herself with a shudder.</p>
<p>She measured the distance to the ground,
and then shook as with a chill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use,&rdquo; she told herself. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m trapped.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning about, she tried to peer into the
dark depths of the hayloft.</p>
<p>As she did so, she became conscious of a
beam that lay directly before her. This beam,
which ran the length of the barn, was suspended
by iron bars at a distance of two feet
from the peak. It formed a track along which,
in haying time, a car carried great bundles of
loose hay to all parts of the loft.</p>
<p>As she looked she saw that stray moonbeams
lighted this track at regular intervals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cupolas,&rdquo; she told herself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_264">[264]</div>
<p>She had noted that curious little structures,
perfect little barns, some four feet square and
six feet high, had been placed along the
ridge of the barn. These were in truth cupolas.
Their sides were made of slanting
slats. These let in air, and kept out rain.
They were for the purpose of ventilation.
New made hay needs air.</p>
<p>She studied this beam with dawning hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I could climb out over that beam,&rdquo; she
told herself, &ldquo;I could swing up into the first
cupola. I might then be able to reach the roof
and at last the ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was uncertain, but worth the risk.</p>
<p>Gripping the beam with both her strong
hands, she let go her feet and, swinging in
midair, made her way hand over hand along
the beam until she was beneath the cupola.</p>
<p>Now for swinging up. This seemed easy.
It was difficult. Was it impossible? Twice
she swung her legs up. Twice she failed.</p>
<p>Her arms were tiring. If she failed again
could she make her way back to the ladder?
She doubted it. And to fall!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_265">[265]</div>
<p>One last desperate endeavor. A toe caught.
She swung the other foot over. She clung
there a moment. Then, after executing a revolving
motion, she lay panting atop the
beam, beneath the cupola.</p>
<p>Ah! How sweet life was! How cool the
air from the cupola that fanned her cheek!
How good it all was!</p>
<p>But there remained much to be done. She
roused herself; dragged herself to her knees,
then stood erect in the cupola.</p>
<p>At once there came a wild and noisy whirring
of wings. Pigeons were sleeping there.</p>
<p>She caught her breath. Would the gangsters
hear? Would they find her? She wore
the bus boy&rsquo;s brown uniform. They would understand.
She would never return alive.
And life was so sweet!</p>
<p>The pigeons were gone. There came no
other sound. If the gangsters had heard they
had thought nothing of it. Who would?</p>
<p>The slats of the cupola fitted loosely into
grooves. She had only to lift them out. She
took out five and laid them down without a
sound. Then she crept out into the moonlight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_266">[266]</div>
<p>One look told her that at the end farthest
from her, the barn ended in a lean-to. The
eaves of this lean-to reached within ten feet
of the ground. Close by these eaves was an
old straw pile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What could be sweeter?&rdquo; She straddled
the ridge of the roof, then hunched herself
along until she was at the end. There, by
clinging to the edge, she let herself down to
the roof of the lean-to. Down the lean-to roof
she glided. Then, with a spring, she landed
on the straw pile.</p>
<p>She slipped, did a somersault, then tumbled
into a patch of weeds.</p>
<p>She was just picking herself up from this
patch of weeds when she caught a slight sound
to her right. She looked. There was a man, a
guard. He had turned. He was looking her
way. Without doubt he had heard a sound as
she struck the straw pile. But had he seen
her?</p>
<p>Her heart pounded against her ribs as she
crept deeper into the mass of protecting weeds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_267">[267]</div>
<h2 id="c31"><br />CHAPTER XXXI
<br />THE CREEPING SPOT</h2>
<p>In the shack on Grand Avenue, Drew Lane
stirred uneasily in his sleep. He awoke at
last. With that feeling which so often comes
to us in the middle of the night, that something
is not right, he sat up in bed.</p>
<p>He stared about him. Johnny&rsquo;s cot was
empty. He could not understand. He threw
on a light. Johnny was not in the room. He
went to the door and looked out. He was nowhere
to be seen.</p>
<p>The creaking of the door awakened the veteran
detective.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo; he asked sleepily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnny&rsquo;s gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nowhere to be seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gone!&rdquo; Newton Mills sprang out of bed.
He began to walk the floor.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_268">[268]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Gone! I should have warned him. That&rsquo;s
the trouble with a boy. There are so many
things he must be told. Judgment; that&rsquo;s what
a boy lacks. Judgment comes only with years
of experience. Gone; and the bullets gone
with him! They have him. They have the
bullets. The case is lost!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t say that exactly.&rdquo; Drew Lane
spoke in a quiet, even voice. &ldquo;He must have
left the shack for something. They must have
got him. That is unfortunate. Will they get
the bullets? I doubt it. Johnny is an unusual
boy. I haven&rsquo;t lived with him all this time
without knowing that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if the bullets are gone, we have a witness,
Rosy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She must live. Life is too beautiful for
such a girl to part with it so soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet it has ended for many at her age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two men fell into silence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_269">[269]</div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll call up headquarters,&rdquo; said Drew at last.
&ldquo;The night chief will send some men over to
question old Mask Face, who says his name
is Jimmie McGowan. They&rsquo;ll make him tell
where the gang hangs out. We&rsquo;ll get Johnny
back yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jimmie McGowan was one person who
talked only when he chose to talk. The men
from the Detective Bureau learned nothing of
any importance from him.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>In the meantime Joyce Mills, in her bus boy
costume, was creeping through the weeds
down a one-time cattle lane that led away
from the barn toward the wheatfield.</p>
<p>Once she reached the field, she rose on
hands and knees to crawl toward a wheat
shock. She was nearing the dark shadow cast
by one of these shocks when a shot rang out.</p>
<p>Dropping flat in the shadows, she waited
and listened, breathless. She heard the blood
beating in her temples. It was like the ticking
of a watch in the dark.</p>
<p>Creeping around the shock, she started
toward another. She had just reached the
second shadow when she heard a gruff voice
say:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_270">[270]</div>
<p>&ldquo;What you shoot at?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something dark moving out there. Dog,
maybe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wolf, maybe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the girl&rsquo;s blood raced. Would they
come to search for her?</p>
<p>An idea occurred to her. These shocks
were like miniature tents. The bundles were
long. They were set two and two, one against
the other. The shocks were long. There was
room for a slim person like herself to creep in
there without disturbing a single bundle.</p>
<p>No sooner thought than done. Wriggling
like a snake, she worked her way into the
center of the shock. She lay there, head upon
one arm, quite still.</p>
<p>The day had been warm. The night air was
chill. The earth beneath the shock and the
shock itself were still warm. How cosy it was!
What a sweet place for a few pleasant dreams.
The night was well on. She felt the need of
sleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_271">[271]</div>
<p>&ldquo;But I must not sleep!&rdquo; she whispered fiercely.
&ldquo;I must get away. Somehow I must get
to the city.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For half an hour she lay there wide-awake.
No further sound came to her. Without doubt
the dark spot had been forgotten.</p>
<p>She crept from beneath the shock. She
crawled from the shadow to another shadow,
and another, until the barn was far away. At
last she sprang to her feet and ran for a cornfield.</p>
<p>Once in the cornfield she was safe. The
corn was above her head. Ten men on horseback
could not have found her there.</p>
<p>By following a row of corn she came at last
to a fence and a road.</p>
<p>She tramped the road for an hour. Then
a truck driver gave her a lift. He stared at
her strange costume, but thought of course
that she was a boy.</p>
<p>He was on his way to the city. Did his
truck carry flour, melons, green corn, or
moonshine? The girl will never know because
she did not ask. She curled back in one corner
of the seat and went fast asleep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_272">[272]</div>
<h2 id="c32"><br />CHAPTER XXXII
<br />SKY HIGH</h2>
<p>In the granary room of the abandoned farmstead,
Johnny was being questioned by
some very angry men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had the slugs. You can&rsquo;t deny that!&rdquo;
Volpi exclaimed with an oath. &ldquo;What have
you done with them? Did you drop them in
the car? Where are they?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnny was puzzled. What should he say?
He might tell them the whole truth, that he
had dropped them with his letter into the
mail box back there in the city. As far as the
bullets went, this would do no harm. They
could not possibly return to the mail box and
rifle it before the collector arrived and carried
the package away. But would not this hasten
his own death? Once in possession of the
whole truth, they would not hesitate to kill
him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_273">[273]</div>
<p>His reply was: &ldquo;I do not know where the
bullets are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this he told the exact truth. For who
can tell at what hour mail is collected from
street boxes at night? Or is it collected at all
between midnight and 6:00 A.M.? Johnny did
not know. Perhaps the package still lay in
the box. Perhaps by this time it was in a
branch post office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; The gunman sprang
at his throat. A companion pulled him back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so fast, Mike,&rdquo; he grumbled. &ldquo;Plenty
of time. He will tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He whispered a few words in Volpi&rsquo;s ear.
Volpi nodded.</p>
<p>The man left the room. Johnny thought he
heard him jimmying a window to the house.</p>
<p>No doubt he interpreted the sounds correctly.
The man returned presently. Then
they all marched to the house, pushing Johnny
before them.</p>
<p>Arrived at the house, they thrust Johnny
unceremoniously into a dark cellar and barred
the doors behind him.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_274">[274]</div>
<p>The place was cold and damp; full of evil
smells. There were rats. He could hear them
scurrying about as he made his way over the
uneven floor.</p>
<p>There were two windows. These were high
up and very narrow. If he pried one of them
open could he escape? The thing seemed dubious.
Soon enough he discovered that his
captors had left nothing to the imagination.
The windows were heavily barred on the outside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Been used as a prison before!&rdquo; His blood
went cold at the thought of the dark deeds
that might have taken place in this evil smelling
and gloomy hole.</p>
<p>Feeling his way back to the stairs, he
crawled part way up, then sat down. He
would not dare sleep because of the rats. On
the stairs he was safest from them.</p>
<p>He heard the gangsters rattling the lids of
a stove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going to cook a meal,&rdquo; he told himself.</p>
<p>He did not expect to be fed. He was not.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_275">[275]</div>
<p>Very soon he began to realize that there was
something besides food in the house. There
was intoxicating drink. The party became
noisy. Moment by moment the hubbub increased
in volume until it was a revel.</p>
<p>After that, by degrees, it subsided. &ldquo;All
drunk and gone to sleep,&rdquo; he told himself.
&ldquo;What a time to escape!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Search as he might, he could find no means
of breaking the bars of the windows. The
plank door was impregnable. At last he gave
up and seated himself once more on the stairs
to await the dawn.</p>
<p>What occupied his thoughts during these
long hours? One might well be surprised. He
was thinking of dark, shadowy forests, where
the ferns grow rank and the pheasant rears
her young. He was seeing a deep, blue-green
fishing hole where black bass lurk and great
muskies fan the water as an eagle fans the
air. Who can say what relief one may find,
from surroundings that are terrible, by contemplating
that which is beautiful, though
very far away?</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>Drew Lane had just returned to the shack
from a disheartening search for some clue that
would lead to a knowledge of Johnny&rsquo;s whereabouts,
when an apparition burst in upon him;
a person he had known for a girl, but who
wore torn and soiled boy&rsquo;s clothes, and whose
complexion had turned a very dark brown.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_276">[276]</div>
<p>&ldquo;You are Joyce Mills!&rdquo; He stared at her in
amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she admitted, dropping into a chair.
&ldquo;And I know where Johnny Thompson is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen!&rdquo; She held up a hand.</p>
<p>In just three minutes by the clock, she had
sketched the whole story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But do you know the exact way to this
farm?&rdquo; Drew demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&rsquo;m sorry, I do not. I&mdash;I fell asleep.
I&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you know the barn if you saw it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes. Surely. It is a large red barn.
The paint is old. There are three cupolas. Five
slats from one cupola are gone. I took them
out myself.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_277">[277]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good! Here&rsquo;s where the police use an airplane.
You&rsquo;re not afraid to fly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl sprang to her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down. Drink this.&rdquo; He poured a steaming
cup of coffee. &ldquo;Eat these.&rdquo; He slammed
a plate of doughnuts on the table.</p>
<p>He dashed to the phone. One call, then another,
and another.</p>
<p>Joyce had just swallowed her third doughnut
when Drew seized her and whirled her,
dirty rags and all, into a squad car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;CLANG! CLANG! CLANG!&rdquo; went the
gong. They were away.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_278">[278]</div>
<p>Half an hour later, in an aviation suit three
sizes too large for her, the girl saw the earth
drifting away from her as she rose toward
the fleecy clouds that floated lazily in an azure
sky.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>That morning the mail collector on Grand
Avenue was not a little puzzled over a package
which was quite properly addressed to a
Johnny Thompson of a certain address on
Grand Avenue. All the package lacked was
postage. The place addressed was but two
blocks away. Since he would be passing it
in a very short time, he might easily have
dropped it there. This, however, would have
been contrary to postal regulations. He carried
the package to a branch office. There a
clerk made a record of the affair. After putting
in the mail a card notifying Johnny
Thompson that a package mailed to him
without sufficient postage lay in that office,
subject to his order, he threw the package in
a pigeonhole and promptly forgot about it.
And that, as you will know, was the package
of incriminating bullets which had caused
great commotion in more than one quarter.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_279">[279]</div>
<h2 id="c33"><br />CHAPTER XXXIII
<br />THE SHOW-DOWN</h2>
<p>Had it not been for the anxiety that filled
their hearts, the airplane flight would
have been an affair crowded with joy for Drew
Lane and Joyce Mills. The day was perfect.
A faint breeze wafted fleecy clouds about
them. The fields, squares of gold and green,
dotted here and there by white houses and red
barns, were an ever changing picture.</p>
<p>Straight as a crow they flew for twenty
miles. Then swooping down low, they began
to circle. With never tiring eyes Joyce
searched the earth beneath her for the object
she sought.</p>
<p>Barns aplenty passed beneath them, but not
<i>the</i> one.</p>
<p>Joyce was beginning to despair when, upon
entering their fourth great circle, she spied a
barn with a gaping cupola.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_280">[280]</div>
<p>Gripping the young detective&rsquo;s arm, she
pointed away to the west. He understood.
They circled back. The barn loomed within
their view. He studied her face, read there
the look of joy; then he understood again. He
directed his plane at full speed back toward the
city airport.</p>
<p>An hour later, the fastest squad car in the
city&rsquo;s service sped westward toward the
suburbs and into the open country. It carried
six burly detectives, one machine gun,
two riot guns and four rifles. Crowded between
Drew Lane and Herman McCarthey,
still clad in her much damaged brown suit,
rode Joyce Mills.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>At the abandoned farmhouse the gangsters,
drowsy from the poison they had taken into
their systems the night before, slept late.
When at last they awoke, they were in a
quarrelsome mood.</p>
<p>Johnny, still sitting on the stairs, hungry,
thirsty, longing for sleep, heard them, and
trembled.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_281">[281]</div>
<p>After half an hour of raving and tramping
about the house, the men calmed down and
appeared to hold a consultation.</p>
<p>They approached the cellar door. As one
heavy bar was thrown back, Johnny dropped
noiselessly to the cellar floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The end has come!&rdquo; he told himself. At
the same time he resolved to sell himself as
dearly as possible. These were wicked men
who richly deserved to die.</p>
<p>The second bar was removed. The door
was thrown open. Mike Volpi appeared on
the threshold. In one hand, supported by a
strap, he carried a three gallon glass jug. The
jug was filled to the very top with some colorless
liquid. Still carrying the jug, the man
made his way unsteadily down the stairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here!&rdquo; He spoke with the fierce growl
of an angry dog as he looked at Johnny
through bleared eyes. &ldquo;You know where them
slugs are. You are going to tell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know where they are,&rdquo; Johnny
answered in a steady, even tone.</p>
<p>His tone angered the gangster.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_282">[282]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Har, har!&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;Did you hear
him? He don&rsquo;t know where them slugs are.
Well, that&rsquo;s good! He don&rsquo;t. Nobody does.
Well then, they don&rsquo;t tell no stories.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;nor you don&rsquo;t neither!&rdquo; He turned
fierce, glistening eyes on the boy. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll tell
no tales. Do you hear me?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know what&rsquo;s in this jug?&rdquo; He laughed a
fiendish laugh. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s alki&mdash;alcohol you&rsquo;d call
it. Alki&rsquo;s hard to get these days. But we
don&rsquo;t grudge the cost. We&rsquo;re going to give
you a mighty sweet death, we are.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some cheap ones would use kerosene.
Bah! Kerosene stinks!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this. How sweet it smells!&rdquo; He removed
the cork and put it to his nose. &ldquo;Mm!
How sweet! Pity to waste it!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there, we ain&rsquo;t tight. We ain&rsquo;t. We&rsquo;ll
use it, every drop!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know what?&rdquo; He dropped his voice to a
whisper. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a patch of woods over
yonder a mile. Forest Preserve. Campers
make fires there. Nobody notices smoke.
We&rsquo;re going to light a torch there, a flamin&rsquo;
torch. You and this alki. Do you understand?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_283">[283]</div>
<p>Johnny did understand. His heart paused.
They meant to soak him in alcohol, then burn
him alive. He had heard of such things, but
had not believed them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be a sweet death,&rdquo; the half drunk man
raved on. &ldquo;Such a sweet death. All alki,
hundred per cent. A sweet&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He broke off short, to stare at the wall. His
face went white. His lips remained apart.
His hands began to tremble. The glass jar
dropped to the floor. It broke into a thousand
pieces. The alcohol filled the air with a pungent
odor as it flowed across the floor.</p>
<p>On the wall before Mike Volpi had appeared
the arrow of fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The arrow of justice!&rdquo; he murmured
thickly.</p>
<p>The next instant there came the sound of
other breaking glass; a window was smashed
from without. A voice said: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t move!
Stick &rsquo;em up! Quick now! We&rsquo;ve got you
covered&mdash;machine gun!&rdquo; It was Herman McCarthey&rsquo;s
voice. The squad had arrived.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_284">[284]</div>
<p>By way of emphasis a machine gun went
<i>rat-tat-tat</i>, and three bullets spat against the
wall. The gunmen acknowledged a master.
Up went their hands.</p>
<p>Johnny was not long in securing their weapons.
Then they were marched, single file, out
of the cellar, and each one handcuffed to a
police officer.</p>
<p>On searching the house, besides other articles
they found a number of ladies&rsquo; garments,
all new and in original packages. These, beyond
doubt, were part of the loot taken from
some store. Joyce Mills was glad enough to
accept the loan of some of these, and so embraced
an opportunity to become once more
a lady.</p>
<p>The gangsters were taken to the city in the
squad car. Two police officers commandeered
the gangster&rsquo;s car. There was room for
Johnny, Drew and Joyce in the back seat. So
they rode happily back to town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; said Drew, &ldquo;I heard good
news this morning. Rosy is past danger.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_285">[285]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; In one word Johnny uttered a
prayer of thanksgiving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;We will get the reward,
won&rsquo;t we? Two thousand!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Between us,&rdquo; said Drew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My share goes toward sending Rosy and
her mother back to Italy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Between us,&rdquo; Drew answered again.</p>
<p>For a time they rode on in silence. Joyce
Mills was fumbling with something beneath
her jacket.</p>
<p>All at once there appeared on the back of
the seat before them a faint red arrow. It
flamed up in a peculiar manner.</p>
<p>Drew and Johnny stared. Joyce laughed a
low laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a trick,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve used it
before. Sometimes you can do with a trick
what you can&rsquo;t do with a cannon. You can
frighten gunmen. They are very superstitious.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_286">[286]</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is really very simple.&rdquo; She displayed a
long black tube. &ldquo;One flashlight, plus a reading
glass, makes a small stereopticon. Over
the glass of the flashlight I pasted a black paper
in which the figure of an arrow had been
cut. Before this I set a strip of glass. The
glass is red, but is darker in some spots than
others. The reading glass focuses the light
so that the arrow becomes definite in form and
intensely red. By moving the strip of red
glass back and forth I am able to make the
arrow appear to be on fire. Very simple, isn&rsquo;t
it? But it worked!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Johnny. &ldquo;It worked. Once it
worked too well; came near causing us to
crash into a wall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you know I rode the back of the gangster&rsquo;s
car all the way out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guessed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joyce told Johnny the rest of the story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Drew when she had finished,
&ldquo;that it is time we had some real women on our
detective force.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_287">[287]</div>
<p>&ldquo;Give me a job,&rdquo; laughed Joyce.</p>
<p class="center"><span class="gs">* * * * * * * *</span></p><p>Two days later the Seventy Club was raided.
This time the detective squad did not stop
at the main floor. There was room for three
men in each of those curious telephone booths.
Three times six is eighteen. Each officer carried
two guns. Two times eighteen is thirty-six.
That was too many for the gunmen and
the ladies down below. They surrendered
without a fight. The place was padlocked.
Five of the men and three of the ladies taken
had been wanted for some time by the police.
Joyce attempted to give credit for this discovery
to her father. He would have none of
it. He told on her.</p>
<p>Johnny had no trouble in retrieving the
package of bullets which he had entrusted to
the care of Uncle Sam in such a strange manner.
The cases against Jimmie McGowan,
Mike Volpi and their confederates were complete.
For once a well selected jury and an
unimpeachable judge gave a gang of gunmen
their just deserts.</p>
<p>The reward was paid.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_288">[288]</div>
<p>A month later, a scene half cheerful, half
sad, was enacted at the Ramacciotti cottage.
Rosy and her mother, smiling their best to
keep back the tears, walked out of the cottage
for the last time. A taxicab was waiting.
They were on their way to the depot, bound
for Italy. They were just an Italian mother
and daughter; simple, kindly folks, just such
people as we almost all are. Yet they mattered
much to some; to Johnny and Drew, to
Herman McCarthey and Newton Mills.</p>
<p>Johnny and Drew helped them into the cab,
gripped their hands in a last farewell; then
they turned to walk back to the shack.</p>
<p>Drew paused to lock the cottage which had
been Mother Ramacciotti&rsquo;s. He had bought
the furnishings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will you do with the cottage now?&rdquo;
Johnny asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen.&rdquo; Drew&rsquo;s look was serious, sad.
&ldquo;We are going on a vacation, you and I, Herman,
Newton Mills, and Joyce. Before that
vacation is over, unless conditions change, the
gunmen will have provided us another widow
and more orphans to fill that cottage. I mean
to keep it till there are no more. God grant
that the time may soon come!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_289">[289]</div>
<p>A week later Johnny, Drew and Joyce were
seated in a clinker-built rowboat over a deep,
dark hole that lies close to shore on the north
side of Lake Huron. On the shore was a cabin.
In a sunny spot before the cabin Herman McCarthey
and Newton Mills sat spinning yarns.
For life must not be all work. Man&rsquo;s nature
demands a change. They were enjoying the
change along with those who were younger.</p>
<p>Drew Lane&rsquo;s experiences as a detective were
not over. They were but well begun. The
problems of enforcing the law and maintaining
order in a great republic are never fully
solved. They go on from year to year and
from generation to generation. Drew Lane
was destined to do his full part. And Johnny
Thompson, as his understudy, was not to lag
far behind. If you are to realize this to the
full, you must read our next book entitled
<i>The Gray Shadow</i>.</p>
